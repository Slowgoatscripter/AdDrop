## What It Requires

### License Number Display (ORC § 4735.16)

All real estate advertising in Ohio must include the licensee's license number. This applies to:
- Print advertising (newspapers, magazines, flyers, postcards)
- Digital advertising (websites, social media, email)
- Broadcast advertising (radio, television)
- Signage (yard signs, billboards, vehicle wraps)
- Marketing materials (brochures, business cards)

**Format requirements:**
- License number must be clearly visible
- Must be displayed in a reasonably prominent manner
- No minimum font size specified, but must be legible
- May use "License #" or "OH License #" prefix

### Brokerage Name Display (ORC § 4735.16, OAC 1301:5-1-02)

All advertising must include the name of the brokerage firm with which the licensee is affiliated. The brokerage name must:
- Be displayed in a reasonably prominent manner
- Be at least as prominent as any team name or personal name
- Match the name on file with the Division of Real Estate
- Be clearly associated with the advertised property or service

### Internet and Digital Advertising (OAC 1301:5-1-02(G))

For websites, social media, and digital platforms:
- **Licensee identification must appear on every viewable page** — or be accessible via a clearly marked hyperlink on every viewable page
- Licensee identification includes: name, license number, and brokerage affiliation
- For social media posts: identification must be in the post itself or in the profile bio (if profile is public and linked)
- For property listings: identification must be on each listing page, not just the homepage
- For video content: identification must appear in the video or description

### Equal Prominence Rule (OAC 1301:5-1-21)

When advertising includes a team name or personal brand:
- **Brokerage name must be at least as prominent as the team/personal name**
- Prominence is determined by: size, color, contrast, placement, and overall visual emphasis
- The brokerage name cannot be buried in fine print while the team name is large and bold

**Compliant examples:**
- "Smith Team | ABC Realty" (equal size and weight)
- "**ABC Realty** — Smith Team" (brokerage larger or equal)
- "Smith Team at ABC Realty" (equal prominence)

**Non-compliant examples:**
- "**SMITH TEAM** — abc realty" (team name larger/bolder)
- "Smith Team" (missing brokerage name)
- "Smith Team | ABC Realty^" (brokerage in footnote-sized text)

## What It Prohibits

### Misleading or False Advertising (ORC § 4735.18)

It is a prohibited practice for a licensee to:

1. **Make false or misleading statements** about property characteristics, value, or availability
2. **Guarantee future appreciation or profits** from real estate investments
3. **Misrepresent market conditions** or the urgency of a transaction
4. **Fail to disclose material facts** that affect property value or desirability
5. **Use bait-and-switch tactics** (advertising a property not actually available)
6. **Imply endorsements or affiliations** that do not exist (e.g., "official partner of XYZ bank")
7. **Exaggerate property features** beyond what is objectively verifiable

### Specific Prohibited Language (OAC 1301:5-1-02)

- **"Guaranteed ROI"** — cannot guarantee investment returns
- **"No risk investment"** — all real estate carries risk; this is deceptive
- **"Will appreciate X% per year"** — future appreciation cannot be guaranteed
- **"Must sell today"** — creates false urgency if property is not actually time-sensitive
- **"Below market value"** — without objective evidence of market value
- **"Seller desperate"** — unprofessional and potentially misleading
- **"Bank-owned, must liquidate"** — if not actually true
- **"Pre-foreclosure deals"** — if not actually pre-foreclosure properties

### Advertising Without Brokerage Consent (OAC 1301:5-1-02)

Licensees cannot advertise properties or services:
- Without the knowledge and consent of the listing broker
- In a manner that conflicts with the listing agreement
- Using contact information other than the brokerage's official contact unless approved
- Under a team name or personal brand without brokerage approval

## Penalties and Enforcement

### Administrative Penalties (OAC 1301:5-6-10)

The Ohio Division of Real Estate may impose:
- **$200 per violation** for advertising infractions
- **Maximum of $2,500 per citation** (multiple violations may be cited together)
- **Three violations within 12 months** = automatic referral for disciplinary action

### Disciplinary Actions (ORC § 4735.18)

In addition to fines, the Division may:
- Issue a letter of reprimand
- Require additional education or training
- Suspend the licensee's real estate license (30 days to 2 years)
- Revoke the licensee's real estate license permanently
- Place licensee on probation with conditions

### Enforcement Process

1. **Complaint filed** with the Ohio Division of Real Estate (public, client, or competitor)
2. **Investigation** — Division reviews advertising materials and documentation
3. **Notice of violation** — Licensee receives written notice and opportunity to respond
4. **Hearing** — If contested, formal hearing before the Ohio Real Estate Commission
5. **Decision** — Commission issues findings and penalty determination
6. **Appeal** — Licensee may appeal to the Franklin County Court of Common Pleas

### Repeat Offenses

- **Second offense within 12 months:** increased fine, mandatory education
- **Third offense within 12 months:** automatic license suspension hearing
- **Pattern of violations:** grounds for license revocation

## Why It Matters

### Consumer Protection

Ohio's advertising requirements are designed to:
- Ensure transparency about who is responsible for the transaction
- Prevent deceptive marketing that misleads buyers and sellers
- Allow consumers to verify licensure and file complaints
- Maintain professionalism in the real estate industry

### Licensee Accountability

Advertising with clear identification:
- Protects the public by connecting ads to accountable, licensed professionals
- Deters unlicensed activity and fraud
- Allows the Division to enforce standards
- Protects the brokerage's reputation by ensuring proper attribution

### Digital Compliance Challenges

The "every viewable page" rule for internet advertising creates compliance burdens:
- Social media posts must include license information (or link to profile bio)
- Property portals (Zillow, Realtor.com) may have limited fields for licensee info
- Video content and image-based posts require overlays or description text
- Paid ads on Google/Facebook must include identification within character limits

**Best practices:**
- Include license number in social media profile bios
- Use watermarks on property photos with brokerage name
- Add license info to video descriptions and end screens
- Configure website footers with required information on all pages

## Ohio-Specific Market Context

Ohio has a mix of urban, suburban, and rural markets with varying advertising practices:
- **Major metros** (Columbus, Cleveland, Cincinnati) — heavy digital advertising, high competition, frequent team branding
- **College towns** (Athens, Oxford, Kent) — rental advertising, high turnover, student-focused marketing
- **Rural markets** — print advertising still common, personal relationships emphasized
- **Rust Belt communities** — foreclosure and distressed property advertising, sensitivity to misleading claims

## Protected Class(es)

This statute governs **advertising standards and licensee conduct**, not fair housing discrimination. For fair housing protections in Ohio, see:
- **ORC § 4112.02(H)** — Ohio Civil Rights Act (housing discrimination)
- **Federal Fair Housing Act** — 42 U.S.C. § 3604

## Edge Cases

### Social Media Character Limits

**Question:** Twitter/X posts have a 280-character limit. How do I include all required information?

**Answer:** Use abbreviated format and link to full profile:
```
New listing in Dublin! 4BR/3BA, $550K. Details in bio.
J. Smith | ABC Realty | Lic #2024012345
```
Or link to a compliant landing page with full details.

### Property Portals (Zillow, Realtor.com)

**Question:** These sites control the listing format. How do I ensure compliance?

**Answer:**
- Ensure your agent profile on the portal includes license number and brokerage
- Add license info to the property description text field if allowed
- The portal itself is not your "advertisement" if you're using their standard listing format — but any customization (enhanced listings, promoted posts) must include your info

### Video Content

**Question:** Do I need to show my license number in every video?

**Answer:**
- Best practice: Include a text overlay with name, brokerage, and license number at the start or end of the video
- Alternative: Include full licensee information in the video description (YouTube, Facebook, Instagram)
- If the video is hosted on your website, the website footer with licensee info satisfies the requirement

### Email Signatures

**Question:** Must my email signature include my license number?

**Answer:**
- OAC 1301:5-1-02 requires license number on "advertising"
- Personal email correspondence is generally not considered advertising
- Mass email campaigns (newsletters, promotional emails) ARE advertising and must include license number
- Best practice: Include it in all professional email signatures for consistency

### Buyer/Seller Personal Posts

**Question:** If my client posts about their listing on their own social media, do they need my license number?

**Answer:**
- No — the client is not a licensee and is not bound by ORC § 4735.16
- However, if you ask them to post, provide them with compliant language to use
- If you share or repost their content, your share must include your licensee information

### Teams vs. Brokerages

**Question:** Can a team name be registered as a brokerage to avoid the prominence issue?

**Answer:**
- Yes, if the team operates as a separate licensed brokerage entity
- The team would need its own broker license and registration with the Division
- If the team is a marketing name within a larger brokerage, it remains subject to the equal prominence rule
