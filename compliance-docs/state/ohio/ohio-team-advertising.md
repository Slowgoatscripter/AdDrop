# Ohio Team Advertising Requirements

## Law

**Ohio Administrative Code (OAC) 1301:5-1-21** — Team advertising requirements

**Ohio Revised Code (ORC) § 4735.16** — Advertising requirements for real estate licensees

Part of Ohio's real estate advertising and licensing regulations.

Related provisions:
- **OAC 1301:5-1-02** — Advertising rules (general requirements)
- **OAC 1301:5-1-02(G)** — Internet and digital advertising
- **ORC § 4735.05** — Powers and duties of the Ohio Division of Real Estate

Enforcement: **Ohio Division of Real Estate and Professional Licensing** (within the Ohio Department of Commerce)

## What It Requires

### Equal Prominence Rule (OAC 1301:5-1-21)

When a real estate team advertises under a team name, the **brokerage name must be at least as prominent as the team name** in all advertising.

"Prominence" is determined by evaluating:
1. **Size** — font size, image size, logo size
2. **Color** — contrast, brightness, visual emphasis
3. **Typeface** — bold vs. regular, uppercase vs. lowercase
4. **Placement** — top vs. bottom, center vs. margin
5. **Overall visual emphasis** — what the eye is drawn to first

### What Qualifies as "At Least as Prominent"

The brokerage name must be **equal to or greater than** the team name in visual prominence. This means:
- Same size and weight (equal prominence) ✓
- Brokerage name larger or bolder (brokerage more prominent) ✓
- Team name larger or bolder (team more prominent) ✗

### All Advertising Media

The equal prominence rule applies to:
- **Print advertising** (newspapers, magazines, flyers, postcards, brochures)
- **Digital advertising** (websites, social media posts, email signatures, display ads)
- **Signage** (yard signs, billboards, vehicle wraps, banners)
- **Video and multimedia** (YouTube videos, TV commercials, video ads)
- **Marketing materials** (business cards, letterhead, folders)

### Brokerage Name Format

The brokerage name displayed must:
- Match the legal name on file with the Ohio Division of Real Estate
- Or use a recognized trade name or DBA registered with the Division
- Be clearly associated with the property or service being advertised

## Why It Matters

### Consumer Protection

Ohio's equal prominence rule ensures:
- Consumers can identify the licensed brokerage responsible for the transaction
- Transparency about who holds legal responsibility for the transaction
- Clear association between individual agents and their supervising broker
- Accountability in case of complaints or disputes

### Regulatory Compliance

- The Ohio Division of Real Estate actively enforces the equal prominence rule
- Violations discovered through consumer complaints, competitor reports, or routine audits
- Penalties include fines, license suspension, and disciplinary action

### Brokerage Liability

When team advertising obscures the brokerage name:
- Brokerage may face liability for failing to supervise team advertising
- Brokerage's brand is weakened in the market
- Legal responsibility is unclear to consumers

## Penalties and Enforcement

### Administrative Penalties (OAC 1301:5-6-10)

The Ohio Division of Real Estate may impose:
- **$200 per violation** for team advertising infractions
- **Maximum of $2,500 per citation** (multiple violations may be cited together)
- **Three violations within 12 months** = automatic referral for disciplinary action

### Disciplinary Actions (ORC § 4735.18)

In addition to fines, the Division may:
- Issue a letter of reprimand to the licensee and/or brokerage
- Require corrective advertising at licensee's expense
- Suspend the licensee's real estate license (30 days to 2 years)
- Revoke the licensee's real estate license permanently
- Suspend or revoke the brokerage's license if pattern of non-compliance

### Enforcement Process

1. **Complaint or audit** — Division identifies potential violation
2. **Notice** — Licensee/brokerage receives written notice and opportunity to respond
3. **Review** — Division evaluates advertising materials and prominence analysis
4. **Penalty determination** — Fine, corrective action, or hearing referral
5. **Appeal** — Licensee may appeal to the Ohio Real Estate Commission or court

## Edge Cases

### Team Name Registered as DBA

**Question:** Our team name "Smith Team" is registered as a DBA (doing business as) under our brokerage. Does the equal prominence rule still apply?

**Answer:** Yes. Even if the team name is a registered DBA of the brokerage, the underlying brokerage legal name must still be displayed with equal prominence. The DBA registration does not eliminate the equal prominence requirement.

**Compliant approach:**
- "Smith Team | ABC Realty" (both displayed equally)
- "ABC Realty dba Smith Team" (brokerage name first, equal weight)

### Multi-Line Layout

**Question:** Can I put the team name on one line and the brokerage on another line below it, as long as they're the same size?

**Answer:** Yes, as long as:
- Font size is equal
- Font weight is equal (both bold or both regular)
- Color contrast is equal
- Visual hierarchy does not favor the team name (e.g., team name at top in larger visual space)

**Example:**
```
Smith Team
ABC Realty
```
Both 16pt, same font, same weight = **Compliant**

**Example:**
```
[Top 70% of sign]
SMITH TEAM

[Bottom 30% of sign]
ABC Realty
```
Same font size, but team name occupies dominant visual space = **Borderline/Risk**

### Logo Prominence

**Question:** Can I use the team logo prominently if the brokerage name is the same size in text?

**Answer:** Risky. If the team logo is large and visually dominant, while the brokerage name is plain text, the overall visual prominence favors the team. Safer approach:
- Use both team and brokerage logos at equal size
- Or use text for both (equal size and weight)
- Or use brokerage logo larger than team logo

### Social Media Usernames

**Question:** My social media handle is @SmithTeam. Do I need to include the brokerage name in the username?

**Answer:** The Division has not issued specific guidance on usernames/handles, but best practices:
- Include brokerage name in the profile bio with equal prominence
- Use a profile name like "Smith Team at ABC Realty"
- Ensure every post includes brokerage identification with equal prominence

Username alone is not sufficient to meet ORC § 4735.16 and OAC 1301:5-1-21.

### Video Advertising

**Question:** For video ads, where should I display the brokerage name?

**Answer:**
- Display brokerage and team name together at the start or end of the video (equal size)
- Or include in a lower-third graphic throughout the video (equal size)
- Or display in the video description (if the video is hosted on a platform like YouTube, and the description is visible)

Visual prominence in video is assessed frame-by-frame — the brokerage name must be as prominent as the team name whenever either appears.

### Team Name in Domain Name

**Question:** Can I use a domain like SmithTeam.com for my team website?

**Answer:** Yes, you can use the team name in the domain. However:
- The website itself must display the brokerage name with equal prominence on every page (per OAC 1301:5-1-02(G))
- The homepage header, footer, and contact pages should show "Smith Team at ABC Realty" or equivalent

Domain names alone do not satisfy the advertising identification requirement.

## Digital vs. Print Considerations

### Print Advertising
- Easier to control layout and visual hierarchy
- Compliance is assessed based on physical dimensions, color, and placement
- Use rulers or design software to measure font sizes and prominence

### Digital Advertising
- **Responsive design** may cause brokerage name to resize differently than team name on mobile vs. desktop
- **Social media algorithms** may crop images in previews — ensure compliance in all cropped versions
- **Character limits** (Twitter/X, Instagram captions) may require abbreviation — maintain equal prominence even in abbreviated form

**Best practice for digital:**
- Test ad appearance on multiple devices (desktop, mobile, tablet)
- Use design tools to ensure equal font sizes in all responsive breakpoints
- Include full identification in image overlays (not just in text captions, which may be truncated)
