# Ohio Military Status Protections in Housing

## Law

**Ohio Revised Code (ORC) § 4112.02(H)** — Unlawful discriminatory practices in housing

Military status is a protected class under Ohio's housing discrimination law but is **NOT** a protected class under the federal Fair Housing Act for housing. This means Ohio provides broader military status-based protections than federal law.

Related provisions:
- **ORC § 4112.01** — Definitions (defines "military status")
- **ORC § 4112.05** — Exemptions (does not exempt military status discrimination)
- **ORC § 4112.99** — Penalties for violations

Federal law: **Servicemembers Civil Relief Act (SCRA)**, 50 U.S.C. § 3901 et seq. — provides lease termination rights and other protections for active duty service members, but does not prohibit housing discrimination based on military status

## What It Prohibits

### In Advertising

Under Ohio law, it is unlawful to make, print, or publish any notice, statement, or advertisement that indicates any preference, limitation, or discrimination based on **military status** in the sale, rental, or leasing of housing.

This means advertising cannot:
- Express a preference for or against military tenants
- Exclude or discourage military service members from applying
- Use military-status descriptors that signal who is welcome or unwelcome
- Describe ideal tenants in military-related terms
- Suggest that military status makes a tenant more or less desirable

### What Is NOT Covered by the Federal FHA

The federal Fair Housing Act does **not** protect military status as a standalone class in housing. Ohio's military status protection is therefore a **state-only** protection that goes beyond federal requirements.

This means:
- An ad saying "no military" may not violate federal law but **violates Ohio law**
- An ad saying "military preferred" may not violate federal law but **violates Ohio law**
- Ohio real estate agents must be aware of this broader protection

### Definition of Military Status (ORC § 4112.01)

"Military status" includes:
- **Active duty members** of the U.S. Armed Forces (Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps, Space Force, Coast Guard)
- **Veterans** (persons who have served and been discharged or released under honorable conditions)
- **Members of the National Guard**
- **Members of the Reserve components** of the U.S. Armed Forces

The protection applies regardless of:
- Branch of service
- Rank or grade
- Length of service
- Type of discharge (as long as honorable or general under honorable conditions)
- Current active status (veterans are protected even if no longer serving)

## Why It Matters

### Ohio-Specific Military Presence

Ohio has significant military installations and veteran populations:
- **Wright-Patterson Air Force Base** (Dayton) — one of the largest Air Force bases in the U.S.; ~30,000 military and civilian personnel
- **Youngstown Air Reserve Station** (Youngstown)
- **Toledo Express Airport** (Air National Guard)
- **Rickenbacker Air National Guard Base** (Columbus)
- **Camp Perry** (National Guard training facility)
- **Veterans:** Ohio has approximately 700,000+ veterans, one of the largest veteran populations in the U.S.

Landlords near these installations may perceive military tenants as high-turnover or high-risk, but Ohio law prohibits using military status as a basis for housing decisions.

### Penalties

**Ohio Civil Rights Commission Penalties:**
- Compensatory damages (actual financial harm and emotional distress)
- Punitive damages (up to $10,000 for first offense; up to $25,000 for second offense within 5 years; up to $50,000 for three or more offenses within 7 years)
- Injunctive relief (court order to cease discriminatory practices)
- Attorney's fees and costs

**Federal SCRA Violations (if applicable):**
- Fines up to $100,000 for violations
- Imprisonment up to one year for knowing violations
- Civil penalties and damages

### Complaint Process

**Ohio Civil Rights Commission:**
- Complaints filed with the Ohio Civil Rights Commission
- **1-year filing deadline** from the date of the discriminatory act
- Investigation typically takes 180-300 days
- Conciliation conference offered for voluntary resolution
- If no resolution: formal hearing before the Commission
- Alternative: Civil action in state court

**Military Legal Assistance Offices:**
- Active duty service members may also seek assistance from base legal offices
- Legal assistance offices can refer complaints to appropriate enforcement agencies

## Protected Class(es)

**Military Status** — active duty, veterans, National Guard members, reservists (all branches)

## Examples

### Violations

#### Explicit Exclusions
- **"No military"** — explicit exclusion based on military status
- **"Prefer civilian tenants"** — expresses preference against military
- **"Active duty need not apply"** — excludes current service members
- **"Due to frequent deployments, we do not rent to military"** — uses military status as basis for refusal
- **"No service members"** — explicit exclusion
- **"Must be employed full-time locally (military excluded)"** — carves out military exclusion

#### Implicit Exclusions
- **"Seeking stable, long-term tenants — no frequent relocations"** — proxies for military turnover
- **"Deployments are not compatible with our lease terms"** — targets military service obligations
- **"Must be available for in-person lease signing at all times"** — may disproportionately exclude deployed service members
- **"No extended absences allowed"** — targets deployments
- **"Prefer tenants with predictable schedules"** — implies military schedules are problematic

#### Preferences (Even Well-Intentioned)
- **"Veterans preferred"** — expresses preference for veterans over non-veterans
- **"Military-friendly housing"** — implies preference for military tenants
- **"Discounts for active duty"** — discriminates in terms/conditions based on military status
- **"Perfect for officers stationed at Wright-Patterson"** — targets specific military demographic
- **"We love our service members!"** — while positive, expresses a preference

### Compliant Alternatives

- **"Convenient to Wright-Patterson AFB"** — describes location without preference
- **"5 miles from downtown Dayton"** — neutral location description
- **"Short-term leases available"** — describes lease flexibility without targeting military
- **"Furnished apartments available"** — describes amenities
- **"We accept Housing Choice Vouchers and VASH vouchers"** — mentions accepted programs without requiring them
- **"All qualified applicants welcome"** — inclusive statement
- **"Income and credit requirements apply"** — legitimate, neutral criteria
- **"Flexible lease terms"** — describes lease without referencing military needs
- **"Pet-friendly (no breed restrictions)"** — describes policy (relevant for many military families)
- **"Equal Housing Opportunity"** — compliance statement

## Edge Cases

### "Military-Friendly" Marketing

**Question:** Can I advertise my rental as "military-friendly" near Wright-Patterson AFB to attract service members?

**Answer:** No. While the intent may be positive, "military-friendly" expresses a preference for military tenants, which violates Ohio law. Instead:
- Advertise proximity: "Convenient to Wright-Patterson AFB"
- Describe flexibility: "Short-term leases available" or "Flexible lease terms"
- Mention accepted programs: "VASH vouchers accepted"

**Why it matters:** Expressing a preference for military tenants discriminates against non-military applicants. Ohio law prohibits preferences in both directions.

### VASH Vouchers (Veterans Affairs Supportive Housing)

**Question:** Can I advertise that I accept VASH vouchers?

**Answer:** Yes — mentioning that you accept vouchers is compliant and encouraged as a fair housing practice.

**Compliant:**
- "We accept Housing Choice Vouchers and VASH vouchers"
- "Vouchers welcome"

**Non-compliant:**
- "VASH vouchers required" — implies military/veteran-only housing
- "Veterans only" — explicit military status preference
- "Must have veteran status to apply" — explicit exclusion of non-veterans

### Servicemembers Civil Relief Act (SCRA) Concerns

**Question:** Active duty service members can break leases under SCRA. Can I refuse to rent to them because of this risk?

**Answer:** No. The SCRA provides federal lease termination rights for service members who:
- Receive PCS (Permanent Change of Station) orders
- Receive deployment orders exceeding 90 days
- Enter active duty after signing a lease

Landlords must honor these rights, and refusing to rent to service members because of anticipated SCRA protections violates Ohio's military status protection.

**You cannot:**
- Refuse military tenants due to SCRA concerns
- Require longer leases for military tenants
- Charge higher deposits based on military status
- Add lease clauses that attempt to waive SCRA rights (such clauses are void)

**You can:**
- Apply the same lease terms and deposit requirements to all tenants
- Screen military applicants using the same income, credit, and background criteria applied to all applicants

### Deployment-Related Absences

**Question:** Can I require tenants to be physically present and refuse to rent to service members who may deploy?

**Answer:** No. Requiring physical presence or refusing tenants who may be absent due to military deployments is military status discrimination. However:
- You can require rent to be paid regardless of occupancy (standard lease term)
- You can require a point of contact for emergencies (standard lease term)
- You can enforce lease terms about property maintenance (applied uniformly)

### Military Discounts or Preferences

**Question:** Can I offer a discount to active duty service members or veterans as a gesture of appreciation?

**Answer:** No. While well-intentioned, offering preferential pricing based on military status constitutes discrimination under Ohio law. ORC § 4112.02(H) prohibits discrimination in "terms, conditions, or privileges" of housing, which includes pricing.

**You cannot:**
- Offer "10% off for veterans"
- Waive application fees for active duty
- Provide free months of rent to military families

**You can:**
- Offer discounts to all tenants equally (e.g., "First month free for all new leases signed by June 1")
- Participate in federal programs that support military housing (e.g., accept VASH vouchers)

### Lease Break Fees and Military Tenants

**Question:** Can I charge a lease break fee to active duty tenants who terminate under SCRA?

**Answer:** No. The SCRA allows service members to terminate leases without penalty when they receive qualifying orders. Charging a fee for SCRA-protected terminations violates federal law. However:
- You may charge for actual damages (unpaid rent through the termination date, cost of re-renting)
- You cannot charge "early termination fees" or penalties beyond actual damages

### Housing Near Military Bases

**Question:** I own rental properties near Wright-Patterson AFB. Most of my tenants are military. Can I market to this demographic?

**Answer:** You can describe the location and amenities that are attractive to military families, but you cannot express a preference for military tenants.

**Compliant marketing:**
- "Located 2 miles from Wright-Patterson AFB main gate"
- "Short-term leases available"
- "Flexible move-in dates"
- "Pet-friendly (no breed restrictions)" — military families often have pets due to frequent relocations

**Non-compliant marketing:**
- "Perfect for military families"
- "We specialize in military housing"
- "Military personnel preferred"

## VASH Voucher Considerations

The **Veterans Affairs Supportive Housing (VASH)** program combines HUD-VCHA housing vouchers with VA supportive services for homeless veterans. Landlords who accept VASH vouchers:
- Must treat VASH voucher holders the same as other voucher holders
- Cannot require veteran status from all applicants (even if participating in VASH)
- Can advertise "VASH vouchers accepted" without violating military status discrimination laws (describing accepted payment forms, not tenant characteristics)

### Ohio Source-of-Income Protections

Ohio does not have a statewide source-of-income protection law. Landlords may refuse Section 8 or VASH vouchers in most Ohio jurisdictions. However:
- **Columbus** (city ordinance) — prohibits source-of-income discrimination
- **Cleveland** (city ordinance) — prohibits source-of-income discrimination
- Check local ordinances before refusing vouchers

Refusing vouchers is distinct from military status discrimination:
- **Legal (in most OH jurisdictions):** "We do not accept housing vouchers"
- **Illegal:** "We do not rent to veterans"
