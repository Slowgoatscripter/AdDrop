## What It Prohibits

### Protected Classes in Ohio Housing

Ohio law prohibits discrimination in housing based on the following protected classes:

1. **Race**
2. **Color**
3. **Religion**
4. **Sex** (including pregnancy, gender identity, and sexual orientation as of 2023 guidance)
5. **Familial Status** (families with children under 18, pregnant persons, legal custody)
6. **National Origin**
7. **Disability** (physical or mental impairment)
8. **Ancestry** (not explicitly protected under federal FHA)
9. **Military Status** (active duty, veterans, National Guard, reservists — not protected under federal FHA)

### Ohio Goes Beyond Federal Law

| Protected Class | Federal FHA | Ohio Civil Rights Act |
|----------------|-------------|----------------------|
| Race | Yes | Yes |
| Color | Yes | Yes |
| Religion | Yes | Yes |
| Sex | Yes | Yes (expanded to include gender identity/orientation) |
| National Origin | Yes | Yes |
| Familial Status | Yes | Yes |
| Disability | Yes | Yes |
| **Ancestry** | No | **Yes** |
| **Military Status** | No | **Yes** |

### Specific Prohibited Acts (ORC § 4112.02(H))

It is unlawful for any person, real estate broker, real estate salesperson, or property owner to:

1. **Refuse to sell, lease, or rent** housing because of a protected class
2. **Discriminate in terms, conditions, or privileges** of housing transactions based on a protected class
3. **Make, print, or publish** any notice, statement, or advertisement indicating a preference, limitation, or discrimination based on a protected class
4. **Represent that a dwelling is not available** when it is, in fact, available (based on protected class)
5. **Make inquiries or keep records** concerning the protected class status of applicants (except for lawful purposes like affirmative marketing)
6. **Induce or attempt to induce** sale or rental by representations regarding protected classes entering a neighborhood (blockbusting)
7. **Retaliate** against a person for filing a complaint, participating in an investigation, or opposing discriminatory practices

### Advertising-Specific Rule (ORC § 4112.02(H)(3))

ORC § 4112.02(H)(3) makes it unlawful to:
> "Print, publish, or circulate any statement or advertisement relating to the sale, transfer, assignment, rental, lease, sublease, or acquisition of any housing accommodations, or the loan of money for the acquisition, construction, rehabilitation, repair, or maintenance of housing accommodations that indicates any preference, limitation, specification, or discrimination based upon race, color, religion, sex, familial status, ancestry, military status, disability, or national origin."

This mirrors the federal FHA Section 804(c) language but includes Ohio's additional protected classes: **ancestry** and **military status**.

## Why It Matters

### Additional State-Level Protections

Ohio real estate agents and advertisers must comply with BOTH federal AND state law. Where Ohio law is more protective (ancestry, military status), state law controls. An ad that is legal under federal law may still violate Ohio law.

### Penalties

**Ohio Civil Rights Commission Penalties:**
- Compensatory damages (actual financial harm and emotional distress)
- Punitive damages (up to $10,000 for first offense; up to $25,000 for second offense within 5 years; up to $50,000 for three or more offenses within 7 years)
- Injunctive relief (court order to cease discriminatory practices)
- Attorney's fees and costs

**Federal FHA Civil Penalties (2025 inflation-adjusted):**
- First offense (no prior adjudication): up to $26,262
- One or more prior violations within 5 years: up to $65,654
- Two or more prior violations within 7 years: up to $131,308

Plus compensatory damages, attorney's fees, and injunctive relief under both state and federal law.

### Complaint Process

**Ohio Civil Rights Commission (State Process):**
- Complaints filed with the Ohio Civil Rights Commission
- **1-year filing deadline** from the date of the discriminatory act
- Investigation typically takes 180-300 days
- Conciliation conference offered for voluntary resolution
- If no resolution: formal hearing before the Commission
- Alternative: Civil action in state court

**HUD (Federal Process):**
- Complaints filed with HUD (U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development)
- **1-year filing deadline** from the date of the discriminatory act
- Dual-filing with Ohio Civil Rights Commission is available

### Ohio-Specific Market Context

Ohio's real estate market includes:
- **Military communities** near Wright-Patterson AFB (Dayton), Youngstown ARS, and Toledo — military status protection is particularly relevant
- **Rust Belt cities** with legacy discrimination patterns — Columbus, Cleveland, Cincinnati, Akron, Toledo
- **Appalachian region** (southeastern Ohio) — ancestry and national origin sensitivity
- **Urban-suburban divides** — historical redlining and modern steering concerns
- **Large immigrant communities** — Columbus (Somali, Bhutanese), Cleveland (Eastern European), Cincinnati (Hispanic) — national origin and ancestry protections critical

## Protected Class(es)

All classes listed in ORC § 4112.02(H): **Race, Color, Religion, Sex, Familial Status, National Origin, Disability, Ancestry, Military Status**

## Examples

### Violations (Ohio-Specific)

#### Ancestry Discrimination
- **"Irish heritage neighborhood"** — ancestry-based preference
- **"Seeking applicants with traditional American roots"** — ancestry and national origin discrimination
- **"German-American community"** — ancestry preference
- **"Only longtime Ohio families"** — implies ancestry or national origin restriction

#### Military Status Discrimination
- **"No military"** — explicit exclusion based on military status
- **"Prefer civilian tenants"** — military status preference
- **"Active duty need not apply"** — explicit military exclusion
- **"Veterans only"** — military status preference (even if well-intentioned, still discriminatory)
- **"Frequent deployments not compatible with our lease terms"** — proxies for military status

#### Combined Violations
- **"Quiet, established residents — no military transfers"** — combines military status with housing stability discrimination
- **"Traditional Anglo-Saxon values"** — combines race, ancestry, and national origin
- **"Close-knit Ohio-born community"** — combines ancestry and national origin

### Compliant Alternatives

- **"Beautiful home in [city/neighborhood name]"** — neutral location reference
- **"All qualified applicants welcome"** — inclusive statement
- **"Income and credit requirements apply"** — legitimate financial qualification (must be applied uniformly)
- **"Pet-friendly community"** — describes property policy, not tenant characteristics
- **"Close to Wright-Patterson AFB"** — describes location without preference for/against military
- **"Equal Housing Opportunity"** — compliance statement
- **"We welcome VASH vouchers"** — supportive of veterans without excluding non-veterans

### Advertising Near Military Installations

**Compliant:**
- **"Convenient to Wright-Patterson AFB"** — describes location
- **"Short-term leases available"** — describes lease flexibility without targeting military
- **"Furnished apartments for professionals"** — describes amenities

**Non-Compliant:**
- **"Military-friendly housing"** — implies preference for military tenants
- **"Perfect for officers"** — targets a specific military demographic
- **"No military, too much turnover"** — explicit exclusion

## Edge Cases

### "Military-Friendly" Marketing

**Question:** Can I advertise housing as "military-friendly" near Wright-Patterson AFB?

**Answer:** This is problematic under Ohio law. While well-intentioned, "military-friendly" expresses a preference for military tenants and could be construed as discrimination against non-military applicants. Instead:
- Advertise proximity: "5 minutes from Wright-Patterson AFB"
- Describe flexibility: "Short-term leases available"
- Mention accepted programs: "VASH vouchers accepted" (Veterans Affairs Supportive Housing)

### VASH Vouchers (Veterans Affairs Supportive Housing)

**Question:** Can I advertise that I accept VASH vouchers?

**Answer:** Yes, but carefully:
- **Compliant:** "We accept VASH vouchers" or "Housing Choice Vouchers welcome"
- **Non-compliant:** "Veterans only" or "Must have VASH voucher"

Accepting vouchers is a positive fair housing practice (source-of-income protection). However, requiring vouchers or limiting to veterans crosses into military status discrimination.

### Ancestry vs. National Origin

**Question:** What's the difference between ancestry and national origin?

**Answer:**
- **National origin** = country of birth or citizenship
- **Ancestry** = ethnic or cultural heritage, lineage, descent (may span multiple generations)

Example: A third-generation American of Italian descent is protected based on ancestry (Italian heritage) even though their national origin is the United States.

Advertising like "traditional American families" or "European heritage community" violates ancestry protections even if no foreign national origin is implicated.

### Housing Near Military Bases

Ohio has significant military presence:
- **Wright-Patterson Air Force Base** (Dayton) — one of the largest Air Force bases in the U.S.
- **Youngstown Air Reserve Station** (Youngstown)
- **Toledo Express Airport** (Air National Guard)
- **Rickenbacker Air National Guard Base** (Columbus)

Landlords near these installations may experience higher tenant turnover due to deployments and transfers, but:
- Cannot refuse military tenants due to anticipated turnover
- Cannot require longer lease terms from military tenants
- Cannot charge higher deposits based on military status
- Cannot advertise preferences against military tenants

**Federal Servicemembers Civil Relief Act (SCRA)** also provides lease termination rights for active duty service members who receive PCS (Permanent Change of Station) orders or deployment orders exceeding 90 days — landlords must honor these regardless of local lease terms.

### "Only American Citizens"

**Question:** Can I require tenants to be U.S. citizens?

**Answer:** No. This violates both national origin protections (federal) and ancestry protections (Ohio). Landlords may verify identity and lawful presence for credit/background checks, but cannot categorically exclude non-citizens.

Acceptable:
- "Must provide government-issued ID for application"
- "Background and credit checks required"

Not acceptable:
- "U.S. citizens only"
- "No foreign nationals"
- "Must be born in the U.S."

### Senior Housing (Age-Based)

**Question:** Ohio law does not list "age" as a protected class. Can I advertise "seniors only"?

**Answer:** Age is not a protected class under Ohio's housing discrimination law (unlike Montana, for example). However:
- Federal HOPA (Housing for Older Persons Act) allows 55+ and 62+ communities if they meet specific criteria
- Outside of qualifying HOPA communities, age-based restrictions may still violate the federal FHA's familial status protections if they exclude families with children
- Be cautious: "seniors only" could function as a proxy for disability discrimination (implying "no disabled people who need accessibility features")

Safest approach: Qualify the housing under HOPA, or avoid age-based marketing entirely.
