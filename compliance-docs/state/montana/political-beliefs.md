# Montana Creed and Political Beliefs in Housing

## Law

**Montana Code Annotated (MCA) § 49-2-305** — Discrimination in housing; exemptions

Montana protects **"creed"** as a separate protected class from religion in housing discrimination. The term "creed" is broader than organized religion and encompasses deeply held systems of belief, including political, philosophical, and ethical convictions.

Related provisions:
- **MCA § 49-2-101** — Definitions
- **Montana Constitution, Article II, Section 5** — Freedom of religion (protects freedom of conscience)
- **Montana Constitution, Article II, Section 7** — Freedom of speech, expression, and press

### Note on "Political Ideas" vs. "Creed"

Montana law explicitly protects **"political ideas"** in certain contexts:
- **MCA § 49-2-303** — Employment discrimination (expressly lists "political ideas")
- **MCA § 49-2-308** — Discrimination by the state (expressly lists "political ideas")

In housing (MCA § 49-2-305), the listed protected class is **"creed"** rather than "political ideas" specifically. However, Montana courts have interpreted "creed" broadly to potentially encompass political beliefs and other deeply held convictions, consistent with Montana's strong constitutional protections for individual conscience and expression.

**For advertising compliance purposes, the safest approach is to treat political beliefs as protected in Montana housing advertising under the "creed" umbrella.**

## What It Prohibits

### In Advertising

Under Montana law, it is unlawful to make, print, or publish any advertising that indicates a preference, limitation, or discrimination based on **creed** in housing. This means advertising cannot:

- Express a preference for tenants or buyers who hold particular political views
- Exclude or discourage persons based on their political affiliation or beliefs
- Describe neighborhoods or communities in terms of political identity
- Use language that signals a political test for housing eligibility
- Reference political symbols, affiliations, or ideologies as attributes of a community or its residents

### What "Creed" Covers

"Creed" is broader than organized religion and may include:
- **Religious beliefs** (all faiths and non-belief)
- **Political convictions** (conservative, liberal, libertarian, progressive, etc.)
- **Philosophical systems** (secular humanism, ethical frameworks)
- **Ethical principles** (veganism, pacifism, environmentalism, when held as core identity beliefs)
- **Ideological positions** (held as deeply as religious conviction)

### Why This Matters for AI-Generated Ads

Political language in real estate advertising is a growing concern because:
- Political polarization has led to neighborhood sorting along ideological lines
- Some communities market themselves as politically aligned ("red" or "blue" areas)
- Social media advertising can target based on political affinity
- AI models trained on real estate data may reproduce politically coded language

## Why It Matters

### Montana's Political Landscape
Montana is a politically diverse state with strong urban-rural political divides. Housing advertising that signals political preferences can:
- Discourage people from seeking housing in communities where they would be politically outnumbered
- Perpetuate geographic political segregation
- Create hostile living environments for political minorities
- Violate Montana's strong constitutional emphasis on individual dignity and freedom of conscience

### Enforcement
- Creed-based discrimination complaints can be filed with the Montana Human Rights Bureau
- 180-day filing deadline from the discriminatory act
- Same penalty structure as other housing discrimination violations (up to $10,000 first offense, escalating)

## Protected Class(es)

**Creed** — religious belief, political conviction, philosophical and ethical systems of belief held as core identity

## Examples

### Violations

- **"Conservative community — like-minded neighbors"** — expresses a political preference
- **"Liberal, progressive neighborhood"** — describes the community's political demographics
- **"Trump supporters welcome" or "Biden country"** — explicit political preference in housing advertising
- **"Red state values community"** or **"blue state haven"** — political identity marketing
- **"NRA-friendly neighborhood"** or **"gun-free zone community"** — signals political affiliation through issue-based language
- **"MAGA community"** or **"Resistance neighborhood"** — explicit political identity marketing
- **"Traditional American values"** — functions as political and religious creed signaling
- **"Free-thinking individuals preferred"** — while seemingly open, it implies a creed-based preference
- **"Patriotic community"** — "patriotic" has become politically coded and may signal a preference
- **"Eco-conscious residents only"** — when environmentalism functions as a creed requirement for housing
- **"No political signs allowed — keep it neutral"** — while a property rule, advertising this signals discomfort with political expression that may deter certain creed groups
- **"Faith-and-flag community"** — combines religious creed with political nationalism

### Compliant Alternatives

- **"Friendly, welcoming community"** — describes the social environment without political signaling
- **"Beautiful neighborhood with mountain views"** — describes physical attributes
- **"Close to downtown, parks, and local shops"** — factual amenity proximity
- **"Well-maintained property in quiet area"** — neutral property description
- **"HOA maintains community standards for property appearance"** — legitimate property management reference without political undertones
- **"Active community association"** — neutral organizational description
- **"All qualified applicants welcome — Equal Housing Opportunity"** — inclusive statement
- **"Peaceful setting surrounded by nature"** — describes the environment, not the residents' beliefs
- **"Minutes from [city center] with easy highway access"** — geographic facts

## Edge Cases

### "Community Values" Language
Phrases like "community values," "shared values," or "like-minded neighbors" are problematic because they can signal creed-based preferences. The question is whether an ordinary reader would interpret the language as expressing a preference for residents who hold particular beliefs. In Montana's current political climate, these phrases are risky.

### Political Yard Signs and HOA Rules
An HOA may have rules about yard signs (including political signs). However, advertising the community by emphasizing these restrictions in a way that signals political conformity is problematic. Describe HOA rules neutrally without framing them as a benefit of political homogeneity.

### Neighborhood Near Political Landmarks
Describing proximity to a state capitol building, courthouse, or government center is factual and acceptable. Describing the political character of the people who work there is not.

### Environmental and Sustainability Claims
Advertising that a property has "solar panels," "energy-efficient features," or "EV charging" is a factual property description and is acceptable. Advertising that the community is "for environmentally conscious people" or "green-living advocates only" crosses into creed-based preference territory under Montana law.

### Religious/Political Overlap
Many creed-based issues sit at the intersection of religion and politics (abortion, same-sex marriage, gun rights, environmental policy). When advertising language touches these issues, it may implicate creed protections even if the speaker considers it a "values" statement rather than a political one.

### University and Research Communities
Advertising near universities or research institutions may naturally attract academics and researchers, who may hold particular political views. Describing proximity to educational institutions is acceptable; describing the intellectual or political culture of the community is not.

### "Off-Grid" and "Homesteading" Language
Describing property features that support off-grid living (well water, solar, acreage) is acceptable. Marketing the property to "freedom-loving homesteaders" or "sovereign individuals" enters creed territory by appealing to specific political-philosophical identities.
