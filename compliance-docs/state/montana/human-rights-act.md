## What It Prohibits

### Protected Classes in Montana Housing

Montana's housing discrimination statute protects **more classes than federal law**. Under MCA § 49-2-305, it is unlawful to discriminate in housing based on:

1. **Sex** (including maternity, pregnancy, and sexual harassment)
2. **Marital Status** (not protected under federal FHA)
3. **Race**
4. **Creed** (broader than religion — includes systems of belief)
5. **Religion**
6. **Color**
7. **Age** (not protected under federal FHA for housing)
8. **Familial Status**
9. **Physical or Mental Disability**
10. **National Origin**

### Montana Goes Beyond Federal Law

| Protected Class | Federal FHA | Montana HRA |
|----------------|-------------|-------------|
| Race | Yes | Yes |
| Color | Yes | Yes |
| Religion | Yes | Yes |
| Sex | Yes | Yes (expanded to include maternity/pregnancy/harassment) |
| National Origin | Yes | Yes |
| Familial Status | Yes | Yes |
| Disability | Yes | Yes |
| **Marital Status** | No | **Yes** |
| **Age** | No | **Yes** |
| **Creed** | No (religion only) | **Yes** (broader than religion) |

### Specific Prohibited Acts

Under MCA § 49-2-305, it is unlawful for owners, lessors, managers, real estate brokers, salespeople, or any person to:

1. **Refuse to sell, lease, or rent** housing because of a protected class
2. **Discriminate in terms, conditions, or privileges** of housing based on a protected class
3. **Make, print, or publish** any notice, statement, or advertisement indicating a preference, limitation, or discrimination based on a protected class
4. **Make inquiries** about the protected class status of a person seeking housing
5. **Induce or attempt to induce** a person to sell or rent by representations about a protected class entering the neighborhood (blockbusting)
6. **Retaliate** against a person for filing a complaint or participating in an investigation

### Advertising-Specific Rule

MCA § 49-2-305(1)(c) makes it unlawful to:
> "make, print, or publish or cause to be made, printed, or published any notice, statement, or advertisement that indicates any preference, limitation, or discrimination based on [protected class] or any intention to make the preference, limitation, or discrimination"

This mirrors the federal FHA Section 804(c) language but covers the additional Montana protected classes (marital status, age, creed).

## Why It Matters

### Additional State-Level Protections
Montana agents and advertisers must comply with BOTH federal AND state law. Where Montana law is more protective (marital status, age, creed), state law controls. An ad that is legal under federal law may still violate Montana law.

### Penalties

**Montana State Penalties (Board of Realty Regulation):**
- Discretionary, up to $1,000 per violation

**Federal FHA Civil Penalties (2025 inflation-adjusted):**
- First offense (no prior adjudication): up to $26,262
- One or more prior violations within 5 years: up to $65,654
- Two or more prior violations within 7 years: up to $131,308

Plus compensatory damages, attorney's fees, and injunctive relief under both state and federal law.

### Complaint Process
- Complaints filed with the **Montana Human Rights Bureau**
- **180-day filing deadline** from the date of the discriminatory act (or discovery)
- Investigation assigned within 45 days of filing
- Alternative: Civil action in district court within **2 years**
- Dual-filing with HUD is available for claims that also violate federal law

### Montana-Specific Market Context
Montana's real estate market includes:
- Rural communities where "everybody knows everybody" language can constitute de facto discrimination
- College towns with age-related advertising issues
- Resort communities where seasonal workforce demographics create national origin and age sensitivity
- Native American communities where race and national origin protections are particularly important
- Communities near military bases where marital status and familial status protections are relevant

## Protected Class(es)

All classes listed in MCA § 49-2-305: **Sex, Marital Status, Race, Creed, Religion, Color, Age, Familial Status, Physical or Mental Disability, National Origin**

## Examples

### Violations (Montana-Specific)

- **"Married couples preferred"** — violates Montana's marital status protection (not covered under federal FHA)
- **"Must be 25 or older to apply"** — violates Montana's age protection in housing (except for qualifying 55+/62+ housing)
- **"Young professionals welcome"** — age-based preference, violates Montana law
- **"Traditional Montana values"** — can function as code for creed, race, or religion preferences
- **"Good Christian neighborhood"** — violates both creed and religion protections
- **"No college students"** — likely age discrimination under Montana law
- **"Retired couples only"** — combines age and marital status discrimination
- **"Working professionals"** — can constitute age discrimination (implies young/middle-aged)
- **"American heritage community"** — national origin and potentially race discrimination
- **"Bachelor apartment for one"** — combines sex and marital status implications

### Compliant Alternatives

- **"One-bedroom unit available"** — neutral property description
- **"Lease requires proof of income equal to 3x monthly rent"** — legitimate financial qualification (but must be applied uniformly)
- **"All qualified applicants welcome"** — inclusive statement
- **"Beautiful home in [city/neighborhood name]"** — neutral location reference
- **"Available to all who meet rental criteria"** — neutral qualification reference
- **"Equal Housing Opportunity"** — compliance statement

## Edge Cases

### "Creed" vs. "Religion"
Montana protects both "creed" and "religion" separately. "Creed" is generally understood to be broader than organized religion — it encompasses deeply held systems of belief that may include philosophical, ethical, or political convictions. This means language that discriminates based on worldview (not just organized religion) may violate Montana law even if it would not violate the federal FHA's religion-only protection.

### Age in College Towns
In towns like Missoula (University of Montana) and Bozeman (Montana State University), advertising that targets or excludes college-age renters based on age violates Montana law. Landlords may impose legitimate, uniformly applied criteria (credit checks, income requirements, lease terms) but cannot use age as a proxy for tenant desirability.

### Seasonal and Workforce Housing
Resort towns like Whitefish, Big Sky, and Red Lodge have seasonal workforce housing needs. Advertising that prefers "seasonal workers" or "ski bums" may implicate age protections. Advertising that describes workforce demographics ("perfect for young seasonal staff") is problematic.

### Native American Communities
Montana has seven Indian reservations and one state-recognized tribe. Advertising that references or excludes tribal communities, or uses language that signals racial preferences in areas near reservations, requires particular sensitivity under both state and federal law.
