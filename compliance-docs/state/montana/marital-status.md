# Montana Marital Status Protections in Housing

## Law

**Montana Code Annotated (MCA) § 49-2-305** — Discrimination in housing; exemptions

Marital status is a protected class under Montana's housing discrimination law but is **NOT** a protected class under the federal Fair Housing Act. This is a Montana-specific protection.

Related provisions:
- **MCA § 49-2-101** — Definitions
- **MCA § 49-2-306** — Discrimination in financing of housing (also covers marital status)

## What It Prohibits

### In Advertising

Under Montana law, it is unlawful to make, print, or publish any notice, statement, or advertisement that indicates any preference, limitation, or discrimination based on **marital status** in the sale, rental, or leasing of housing.

This means advertising cannot:
- Express a preference for married, single, divorced, or widowed persons
- Use language that implies a preferred marital or relationship status
- Describe ideal tenants in terms that signal marital status preferences
- Combine marital status language with other preferences (e.g., "married couple with children")
- Induce sale or rental by representations about the marital status of persons in a neighborhood

### Who Is Protected

Marital status protection covers:
- **Single persons** (never married)
- **Married persons**
- **Divorced persons**
- **Separated persons**
- **Widowed persons**
- **Persons in domestic partnerships** (to the extent recognized under Montana law)
- **Cohabiting unmarried partners**

### Overlap with Other Protected Classes

Marital status discrimination frequently intersects with:
- **Sex** — Preferences for "married couples" can discriminate against single women or men
- **Familial status** — "Married families" excludes single parents
- **Religion** — "Traditional marriage" signals religious preferences
- **Sexual orientation** — "Married couples only" may exclude same-sex couples in practice (depending on legal framework)
- **Age** — "Newlyweds" or "empty nesters" combine marital status with age

## Why It Matters

### Why Montana Added This Protection
Federal fair housing law does not protect marital status, creating a gap that disproportionately affects:
- Single parents (especially single mothers)
- Divorced individuals reentering the housing market
- Unmarried couples (including same-sex couples)
- Widowed elderly persons
- Young single adults in competitive rental markets

### Montana Market Context
- Housing in college towns often sees informal preferences for "couples" over "singles"
- Rural communities may have cultural preferences for married families
- Military communities near Montana bases see discrimination against single service members or military spouses
- Seasonal resort areas may prefer "stable married couples" over single seasonal workers

### Penalties
- First offense: Up to **$10,000** (MCA § 49-2-510)
- Prior violations within 5 years: Up to **$25,000**
- Plus compensatory damages, attorney's fees, and injunctive relief

## Protected Class(es)

**Marital Status** — single, married, divorced, separated, widowed

## Examples

### Violations

- **"Married couples preferred"** — explicit marital status preference
- **"Singles welcome" or "singles only"** — while seemingly inclusive of singles, it expresses a marital status preference that excludes married couples (and vice versa)
- **"Perfect for newlyweds"** — targets a specific marital status (and implicitly a specific age range)
- **"Ideal for a married couple with children"** — combines marital status and familial status preferences
- **"No unmarried couples"** — explicit exclusion based on marital status
- **"Divorced? Start fresh in this cozy apartment!"** — targets a specific marital status
- **"Stable family household required"** — "stable family" implies married couple, discriminating against single persons and non-traditional households
- **"Must be married to apply"** — explicit marital status requirement
- **"Traditional family home"** — can function as code for married heterosexual couple with children
- **"Spouse required on lease"** — assumes and requires married status
- **"Couples only — no roommates"** — implies romantic partnership requirement, discriminating against single persons
- **"Empty nesters welcome"** — combines marital status (implies married) with age and familial status implications
- **"Bachelor pad available"** — targets single males specifically

### Compliant Alternatives

- **"One-bedroom apartment available"** — describes the unit without reference to occupant's marital status
- **"Two-bedroom home with updated kitchen"** — describes property features
- **"All qualified applicants welcome"** — inclusive language
- **"Income and credit requirements apply"** — legitimate, marital-status-neutral criteria
- **"Spacious home in quiet neighborhood"** — neutral description
- **"Available for immediate occupancy"** — neutral availability statement
- **"Contact us to schedule a showing"** — neutral call to action
- **"Co-signers and co-applicants accepted"** — allows multiple people on a lease without requiring a specific relationship

## Edge Cases

### Occupancy Limits and Couples
A landlord may set reasonable occupancy limits based on unit size and building codes (e.g., two persons per bedroom). However, treating unmarried couples differently from married couples regarding occupancy violates Montana's marital status protection. If married couples can share a one-bedroom unit, unmarried couples must be allowed the same.

### "Roommates" vs. "Couples"
Advertising "seeking roommates" is generally acceptable as it describes a living arrangement, not a marital status. However, "no couples, roommates only" or "couples only, no roommates" crosses into marital status discrimination by expressing a preference about the residents' relationship status.

### Co-Applicants on Leases
Requiring both members of a couple to be on the lease is acceptable if applied uniformly to all co-occupants regardless of relationship status. However, requiring a "spouse" to co-sign specifically implies a marriage requirement.

### Religious Housing Providers
Religious organizations that operate housing may have beliefs about marriage and cohabitation. However, under Montana law, marital status is a protected class in housing with limited exemptions. The narrow religious organization exemption in the federal FHA does not necessarily override Montana's marital status protection.

### "Family-Sized" Units
Describing a unit as "family-sized" or "great for families" is not a marital status violation — it describes the unit's capacity. The violation occurs when the ad specifies what type of family (married, traditional, etc.) is preferred.

### Military Housing
Near Montana military installations, ads should not prefer "military families" (implying married service members with dependents) over single service members. "Convenient to [base name]" is a neutral location reference.

### "Head of Household" Language
Requiring a "head of household" or "primary breadwinner" on applications can implicitly discriminate based on marital status by assuming a traditional married household structure. Use "primary applicant" or "all occupants" instead.
