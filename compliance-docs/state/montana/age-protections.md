# Montana Age Protections in Housing

## Law

**Montana Code Annotated (MCA) § 49-2-305** — Discrimination in housing; exemptions

Age is a protected class under Montana's housing discrimination law but is **NOT** a protected class under the federal Fair Housing Act for housing. This means Montana provides broader age-based protections than federal law.

Related provisions:
- **MCA § 49-2-101** — Definitions
- **MCA § 49-2-305(3)** — Housing for Older Persons exemption (mirrors federal HOPA)

## What It Prohibits

### In Advertising

Under Montana law, it is unlawful to make, print, or publish any notice, statement, or advertisement that indicates any preference, limitation, or discrimination based on **age** in the sale, rental, or leasing of housing.

This means advertising cannot:
- Express a preference for tenants or buyers of a particular age or age range
- Exclude or discourage persons of a particular age from applying
- Use age-based descriptors that signal who is welcome or unwelcome
- Describe ideal tenants in age-related terms
- Induce sale or rental by representations about the age of persons entering a neighborhood

### What Is NOT Covered by the Federal FHA

The federal Fair Housing Act does **not** protect age as a standalone class in housing (except as a component of familial status for families with children under 18). Montana's age protection is therefore a **state-only** protection that goes beyond federal requirements.

This means:
- An ad saying "young professionals welcome" may be legal under federal law but **violates Montana law**
- An ad saying "retirees only" may be legal under federal law (if not a HOPA community) but **violates Montana law**
- Montana real estate agents must be aware of this broader protection

### Housing for Older Persons Exemption

Montana mirrors the federal HOPA exemption. Age-based restrictions are permitted ONLY for housing that qualifies as:

1. **Government program housing** specifically designed for elderly persons
2. **62+ housing** — 100% occupied by persons 62 or older
3. **55+ housing** — at least 80% of units have one resident 55+, with published policies demonstrating 55+ intent

Outside of these qualifying categories, age-based advertising restrictions are illegal in Montana.

## Why It Matters

### Montana-Specific Concerns
- **College towns** (Missoula, Bozeman, Billings) have significant student populations; landlords cannot use age as a basis for advertising preferences
- **Retirement communities** are growing; unless they formally qualify under HOPA, they cannot exclude younger residents
- **Seasonal resort areas** (Big Sky, Whitefish) attract young seasonal workers; age-based advertising preferences are prohibited
- **Rural communities** may informally prefer older, established residents — this cannot be reflected in advertising

### Penalties

**Montana State Penalties (Board of Realty Regulation):**
- Discretionary, up to $1,000 per violation

**Federal FHA Civil Penalties (2025 inflation-adjusted):**
- First offense (no prior adjudication): up to $26,262
- One or more prior violations within 5 years: up to $65,654
- Two or more prior violations within 7 years: up to $131,308

Plus compensatory damages, attorney's fees, and injunctive relief under both state and federal law.

## Protected Class(es)

**Age** — all ages are protected; no minimum or maximum threshold is specified in the statute

## Examples

### Violations

- **"Young professionals only"** — explicit age preference for younger tenants
- **"Retirees welcome"** — age-based preference (unless qualifying HOPA housing)
- **"No college students"** — while not explicitly age-based, in practice this targets a specific age group and violates Montana's age protection
- **"Perfect for empty nesters"** — implies older adults without children, combining age and familial status preferences
- **"Mature, responsible tenants preferred"** — "mature" functions as an age descriptor
- **"Ideal for seniors"** — age-based preference (unless qualifying HOPA housing)
- **"Not suitable for elderly persons"** — explicit age-based exclusion
- **"Seeking tenants aged 30-50"** — explicit age range restriction
- **"Active lifestyle community — must enjoy hiking and skiing"** — while describing activities, this can function as age discrimination by implying only young/middle-aged people qualify
- **"Great starter home for twentysomethings"** — targets a specific age group
- **"Established professional with stable career"** — implies middle-aged or older, excluding younger people
- **"Working adults preferred"** — excludes retirees and younger people who may not be in the traditional workforce
- **"Recently retired? This is your dream home!"** — targets a specific age demographic

### Compliant Alternatives

- **"One-bedroom apartment near campus"** — describes location without age preference; students and others near campus can all apply
- **"Spacious home with mountain views"** — describes the property, not the ideal occupant's age
- **"Close to trails, parks, and downtown dining"** — describes amenities accessible to all ages
- **"Available now — income and credit requirements apply"** — legitimate, age-neutral qualification criteria
- **"Quiet residential neighborhood"** — describes the environment without implying an age preference
- **"Modern kitchen and updated appliances"** — property feature description
- **"55 and older community"** — acceptable ONLY for properties that legally qualify under HOPA
- **"All qualified applicants welcome"** — inclusive language
- **"Three-bedroom home with large yard"** — neutral property description

## Edge Cases

### Student Housing Near Universities
Advertising "student housing" or "near university" is not per se age discrimination — it describes a use case and location. However, advertising "students only" or "must be enrolled student" may raise age discrimination issues under Montana law if it effectively excludes older adults. The safest approach: describe the property's proximity to educational institutions without specifying who should live there.

### "Active Adult Community" (Non-HOPA)
A community that markets itself as "active adult" but does not meet HOPA requirements cannot legally restrict residency by age. Advertising an "active adult lifestyle" is borderline — it strongly implies an age preference without formal qualification. If the community does not meet HOPA criteria, avoid age-related marketing.

### Physical Activity Descriptions
Describing a property as "great for outdoor enthusiasts" or "near ski slopes" is acceptable — these describe amenities, not age requirements. However, adding "for active, energetic people" crosses into implying a preferred age range.

### Income Requirements
Requiring proof of income (e.g., "income must be 3x monthly rent") is a legitimate, age-neutral criterion. However, requirements like "must have 5+ years of employment history" can disproportionately affect younger applicants and may raise age discrimination concerns.

### Senior Discounts or Incentives
Offering reduced rent or special terms specifically for seniors is problematic under Montana law unless the property qualifies under HOPA. Age-based pricing tiers constitute discrimination on the basis of age.

### Internship or Temporary Work Housing
Advertising housing "for summer interns" or "seasonal workers" is borderline. While it describes a use case, if the practical effect is to target a specific age group, it may raise concerns. Describe the housing terms (short-term lease, furnished) rather than the intended occupant's life stage.
