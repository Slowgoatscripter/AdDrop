# Disability

## Law

The **Fair Housing Amendments Act of 1988 (FHAA)** added disability (referred to as "handicap" in the statute) as a protected class under the Fair Housing Act. The relevant provisions are:

- **42 U.S.C. § 3604(c)** — Prohibits discriminatory advertising based on handicap/disability
- **42 U.S.C. § 3604(f)** — Comprehensive disability discrimination prohibitions, including:
  - § 3604(f)(1) — Discrimination in the sale or rental of housing
  - § 3604(f)(2) — Discrimination in terms, conditions, or privileges of sale or rental
  - § 3604(f)(3)(A) — Refusal to allow reasonable modifications at the tenant's expense
  - § 3604(f)(3)(B) — Refusal to make reasonable accommodations in rules, policies, or services
  - § 3604(f)(3)(C) — Design and construction requirements for covered multifamily dwellings

HUD regulations implementing disability protections: **24 CFR §§ 100.201–100.205**

The **Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA)** also applies to commercial facilities and public accommodations and may overlap with FHA requirements in some housing contexts (e.g., rental offices, common areas of apartment complexes).

## What It Prohibits

### In Advertising

It is illegal to use any language, imagery, or description in housing advertising that:

- Excludes or discourages persons with disabilities from applying
- States or implies that the property is not available to persons with physical or mental disabilities
- Describes required physical abilities of tenants or buyers
- Focuses on physical barriers as a deterrent rather than as factual property descriptions
- Uses stigmatizing language about mental health conditions or substance abuse recovery
- Suggests that persons with disabilities would be unwelcome or unable to live in the property

### Definition of Disability Under the FHA

"Handicap" (the statutory term) means a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more major life activities, including:

- **Physical disabilities**: Mobility impairments, visual or hearing impairments, chronic illnesses (HIV/AIDS, cancer, heart disease, diabetes), orthopedic conditions
- **Mental disabilities**: Depression, anxiety, PTSD, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, intellectual and developmental disabilities, autism spectrum disorders
- **History of disability**: A person with a record of such impairment (e.g., a cancer survivor)
- **Perceived disability**: A person regarded as having such impairment, even if they do not

**Excluded from protection**: Current illegal drug use (but recovered addicts and those in treatment are protected), persons who pose a direct threat to health or safety that cannot be mitigated by reasonable accommodation

### Reasonable Accommodation and Modification
While not directly an advertising issue, ads must not contain language that would discourage requests for:
- **Reasonable accommodations** — Changes to rules, policies, or services (e.g., allowing a service animal in a no-pets building)
- **Reasonable modifications** — Physical changes to the dwelling or common areas (e.g., installing grab bars, widening doorways)

## Why It Matters

### Scope of Impact
- Approximately 1 in 4 adults in the United States lives with a disability (CDC)
- Persons with disabilities face among the highest rates of housing discrimination
- HUD consistently reports disability as one of the top bases for fair housing complaints filed each year

### Common Misconception
Many housing providers and agents believe they can describe physical barriers in a property (stairs, upper floors) as a warning to persons with disabilities. While factual property descriptions are permissible, framing physical features as reasons someone should not live there crosses into discrimination.

### Consequences
- Full FHA penalty structure applies (up to $25,597 first offense, escalating)
- ADA violations may carry additional penalties and compliance requirements
- State disability discrimination laws may impose further liability
- Emotional distress damages tend to be significant in disability discrimination cases

## Protected Class(es)

**Disability / Handicap** — physical disability, mental disability, history of disability, perceived disability

## Examples

### Violations

- **"No wheelchairs"** — explicit exclusion of persons with mobility impairments; clear Section 804(c) violation
- **"Must be able to climb stairs"** — describes a required physical ability, effectively excluding persons with mobility disabilities
- **"Not suitable for handicapped persons"** — direct discriminatory statement
- **"No mentally ill tenants"** — explicit exclusion based on mental disability
- **"Perfect for the physically fit and active"** — implies that persons with physical limitations are not welcome
- **"No blind or deaf tenants"** — explicit exclusion based on sensory disability
- **"Healthy tenants preferred"** — implies persons with chronic illness or disability are not desired
- **"No group homes"** — may violate FHA if it targets housing for persons with disabilities (group homes for persons with disabilities are protected under the FHA)
- **"No service animals" or "absolutely no pets, no exceptions"** — signals unwillingness to make reasonable accommodations for service/support animals
- **"Drug-free community"** — while landlords can enforce rules against illegal drug activity, this phrase may discourage persons in recovery (who are protected) from applying
- **"Third-floor walk-up, not for those with mobility issues"** — combines factual description with discriminatory advice about who should apply
- **"Must be self-sufficient and independent"** — implies persons who need assistance or accommodations are unwelcome
- **"No crazy people"** — uses stigmatizing language to exclude persons with mental health conditions
- **"Seeking tenants in good physical condition"** — describes desired physical attributes of tenants
- **"Normal tenants only"** — implies persons with disabilities are abnormal

### Compliant Alternatives

- **"Third-floor unit, walk-up building"** — factual description of the unit location and building type without suggesting who should or should not live there
- **"No elevator"** — factual building feature; let prospective tenants determine if it works for them
- **"Two-story townhome with bedrooms upstairs"** — factual layout description
- **"Unit features: hardwood floors, open layout"** — describes physical features neutrally
- **"Pet policy: please inquire"** — leaves room for reasonable accommodation discussions without blanket exclusion
- **"Quiet community with walking trails and green spaces"** — describes amenities without describing desired physical abilities
- **"Ground-floor unit available"** — factual description that is naturally appealing to many, including persons with mobility limitations, without targeting
- **"Accessible features: grab bars in bathroom, roll-in shower"** — describing accessibility features is not only acceptable but encouraged
- **"Recently renovated kitchen and bathroom"** — describes property improvements neutrally
- **"Well-maintained building with on-site management"** — describes property management without implying tenant requirements

## Edge Cases

### Describing Physical Features of a Property
It is acceptable to accurately describe the physical characteristics of a property: "third-floor walk-up," "spiral staircase to loft bedroom," "sunken living room with steps." What is NOT acceptable is adding language that advises who should or should not live there based on those features. Let prospective tenants evaluate the property for themselves.

### "Walk-In Closet" / "Walk to Bus Stop" / "Walking Distance"
These phrases are **acceptable**. HUD has explicitly stated that terms like "walk-in closet," "walk to bus stop," and "walking distance to schools" describe property features or neighborhood geography, not the physical abilities of prospective tenants.

### "Master Bedroom" / "Master Bathroom"
These terms are **acceptable** under fair housing law. While some in the industry have moved away from them for other reasons, they do not violate the FHA.

### Service Animals and Emotional Support Animals
Advertising a "no pets" policy is acceptable, but the ad should not state "no exceptions" or "absolutely no animals." Under the FHA, landlords must make reasonable accommodations for service animals and emotional support animals (with proper documentation). Advertising language that forecloses all accommodation requests is problematic.

### Group Homes
Zoning restrictions that target group homes for persons with disabilities may violate the FHA. Advertising language that says "no group homes" or "single-family only" in contexts where it would exclude disability-related group living arrangements is problematic.

### Substance Abuse Recovery
Current illegal drug users are not protected under the FHA. However, persons who have completed or are currently in drug or alcohol rehabilitation programs ARE protected. Language like "drug-free building" could discourage protected individuals in recovery from applying.

### "Healthy Living Community"
This phrase is borderline. If used to describe wellness amenities (gym, yoga studio, organic garden), it is likely acceptable. If used in a context that suggests health is a requirement for living there, it could discourage persons with chronic illness or disability.

### Describing Accessibility Features
Advertising that a property has accessibility features (wheelchair ramp, grab bars, wide doorways, roll-in shower) is **encouraged**, not penalized. Lack of accessibility features should be described factually ("no elevator") without adding evaluative language about who the property is for.
