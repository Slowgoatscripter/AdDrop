# Race, Color, and National Origin

## Law

**Race, color, and national origin** are the original protected classes under the **Fair Housing Act of 1968 (42 U.S.C. §§ 3601–3619)**, enacted as Title VIII of the Civil Rights Act of 1968.

Key statutory provisions:

- **42 U.S.C. § 3604(a)** — Prohibits making housing unavailable based on race, color, or national origin
- **42 U.S.C. § 3604(b)** — Prohibits discrimination in terms, conditions, or privileges
- **42 U.S.C. § 3604(c)** — Prohibits discriminatory advertising
- **42 U.S.C. § 3604(d)** — Prohibits misrepresenting availability of housing
- **42 U.S.C. § 3605** — Prohibits discrimination in residential real estate-related transactions (lending)
- **42 U.S.C. § 3606** — Prohibits discrimination in brokerage services

HUD advertising regulations: **24 CFR Part 109** and **24 CFR § 100.75**

**Executive Order 11063** (1962) also prohibits discrimination in federally assisted housing.

Additional federal protections:
- **Civil Rights Act of 1866 (42 U.S.C. § 1982)** — Provides that all citizens have the same right to purchase, lease, and convey property. This law has NO exemptions and applies to all housing without exception.

## What It Prohibits

### Race and Color
It is illegal to advertise housing in any way that indicates a preference or limitation based on race or skin color. This includes:

- Explicit racial preferences or exclusions
- Descriptions of the racial composition of a neighborhood, building, or area
- Use of code words or proxy language that an ordinary reader would understand as referring to race
- Selective use of human models in advertising that suggests racial preference
- Targeting ads to or excluding them from specific racial groups
- Using neighborhood descriptions that signal racial demographics

**Race and color are distinct protected classes.** Discrimination based on skin color (e.g., preferring lighter-skinned individuals of any race) is prohibited independently of race discrimination.

### National Origin
It is illegal to advertise housing in any way that indicates a preference or limitation based on a person's country of birth, ancestry, culture, or linguistic characteristics. This includes:

- Requiring English proficiency in advertising
- Using nationality descriptors (Chinese, African, German, Italian, etc.) to describe tenants, neighborhoods, or preferred applicants
- Describing the ethnic character of a neighborhood
- Charging additional fees based on language spoken
- Requiring documentation beyond what is legally required in a discriminatory manner
- Advertising only in one language when serving a linguistically diverse market (pattern may indicate targeting)

## Why It Matters

### Historical Context
Race-based housing discrimination was the primary target of the Fair Housing Act. Before 1968, racial discrimination in housing was widespread and often legally sanctioned through:
- Racially restrictive covenants
- Redlining by financial institutions
- Blockbusting by real estate agents
- Explicit racial exclusion in advertising

### Ongoing Impact
- Race and national origin continue to be among the most frequently cited bases for fair housing complaints
- The 2019 Newsday investigation revealed that agents showed Black buyers 50% fewer listings than comparable White buyers on Long Island
- HUD testing studies consistently find differential treatment based on race and national origin
- Algorithmic advertising on digital platforms has created new forms of discriminatory targeting (see HUD v. Facebook, 2019)

### Consequences
- Full FHA penalty structure applies
- Civil Rights Act of 1866 (§ 1982) provides an additional cause of action with NO exemptions — even owner-occupied small buildings and FSBO transactions are covered
- DOJ brings pattern-and-practice cases against brokerages and housing providers
- State and local fair housing laws often provide additional remedies
- Real estate license revocation is common in proven cases

## Protected Class(es)

**Race** — all racial groups, including multiracial individuals
**Color** — skin color distinctions, including within racial groups
**National Origin** — country of birth, ancestry, ethnic heritage, culture, linguistic characteristics

## Examples

### Violations — Race and Color

- **"White neighborhood"** or **"Caucasian community"** — explicitly identifies the racial composition of an area
- **"Colored home"** or **"Black area"** — uses racial identifiers to describe property or neighborhood
- **"Prefer light-skinned tenants"** — explicit color-based preference
- **"Integrated neighborhood"** — identifies the racial composition of the area; while seemingly positive, it references racial demographics
- **"Diverse community"** — directly references the racial or ethnic makeup of the neighborhood (borderline but risky)
- **"Exclusive" or "restricted" neighborhood** — historically used as code for racially segregated areas
- **"Good schools, safe streets"** — when used as a cluster of neighborhood descriptors, these can function as racial code (see Edge Cases)
- **"Urban" or "inner-city"** — commonly understood as racial code words in housing context
- **"Traditional neighborhood"** — can signal racial homogeneity
- **"Changing neighborhood"** — implies demographic (often racial) transition; may constitute blockbusting

### Violations — National Origin

- **"English speakers only"** — directly discriminates based on language, which is a proxy for national origin
- **"Must speak English"** — same as above; language requirements in advertising violate the FHA
- **"American-born residents preferred"** — explicit national origin preference
- **"No immigrants"** — explicit national origin discrimination
- **"Hispanic area"** or **"Asian community"** or **"Little Italy"** — describes the ethnic/national origin composition of the area
- **"Near Chinese restaurants and Asian markets"** — uses ethnic businesses to describe neighborhood demographics
- **"International buyers welcome"** — while seemingly inclusive, it draws attention to national origin as a factor
- **"German village" or "Polish district"** — uses national origin to characterize the neighborhood (unless it is an official, historic neighborhood name)
- **"Citizens only"** — while citizenship status is not a federally protected class, this language often functions as national origin discrimination and may violate state laws
- **"No Section 8"** — while not directly a race/national origin term, this has been found to have a disparate impact on protected classes in many jurisdictions

### Compliant Alternatives

- **"Charming home in [neighborhood name]"** — uses the official neighborhood name without demographic descriptions
- **"Close to shopping, dining, and entertainment"** — describes amenities generically without ethnic or cultural coding
- **"Excellent location near public transportation"** — geographic fact
- **"Well-maintained three-bedroom home"** — describes the property, not the people
- **"Quiet street with mature trees"** — physical description of the environment
- **"Minutes from downtown [city name]"** — objective location reference
- **"Open house Saturday 1-4 PM — all welcome"** — inclusive invitation
- **"Recently renovated kitchen and bathrooms"** — describes property features
- **"Corner lot with fenced backyard"** — physical property description
- **"Available immediately, contact [agent] for details"** — neutral call to action

## Edge Cases

### Neighborhood Names
Using **official, established neighborhood names** is acceptable, even if they have ethnic origins (e.g., "Chinatown," "Little Havana," "Germantown"). These are recognized geographic designations. However, using informal ethnic nicknames that are not official names, or describing a neighborhood by its ethnic character rather than its name, crosses the line.

### Language of Advertising
Advertising in languages other than English is acceptable and can help reach underserved communities. However, advertising **exclusively** in one non-English language, while not per se illegal, may raise questions about targeting. The safest approach is to include both English and other languages, or to advertise broadly.

### "Good Schools" and "Safe Area"
These phrases are not per se violations. However, because school quality and crime statistics correlate with neighborhood racial demographics in many areas, these descriptions can function as racial proxies. The safest approach:
- **Instead of rating schools**: "Near [specific school name]" or "Close to schools" (let buyers research quality independently)
- **Instead of rating safety**: Describe property security features ("gated entry," "security cameras") rather than neighborhood safety

### Cultural Amenities
Mentioning generic amenities ("restaurants," "shops," "parks") is fine. Mentioning **culturally specific** amenities ("Korean BBQ restaurants," "halal markets," "synagogues") describes the ethnic composition of the area and can constitute steering.

### Human Models in Advertising
HUD guidelines state that the racial composition of models in advertising should reasonably represent the community. Using exclusively white models, or exclusively any single race, in a diverse market area suggests a racial preference. Best practice: use diverse models or no human models.

### "Desirable Neighborhood"
This phrase is **generally acceptable** as a subjective opinion about a location. However, in historical context, "desirable" was used in redlining to rate neighborhoods by racial composition. In modern advertising, it is low risk but should be paired with neutral descriptors.

### Digital Ad Targeting
Excluding protected groups from seeing housing ads (e.g., through Facebook's former "ethnic affinity" targeting) violates the FHA even if the ad text itself is neutral. The method of distribution matters as much as the content. HUD's 2024 guidance addresses this for digital platforms.

### "No Section 8" / Source of Income
While source of income is not a federally protected class, several states and cities prohibit source-of-income discrimination. Additionally, "No Section 8" language has been found to have a disparate impact on race and national origin and may trigger an FHA complaint.
