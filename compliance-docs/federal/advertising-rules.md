# Advertising Rules — Federal Requirements

## Law

Multiple federal laws govern real estate advertising beyond the Fair Housing Act's Section 804(c):

### Fair Housing Advertising
- **42 U.S.C. § 3604(c)** — Core advertising prohibition (covered in detail in other compliance docs)
- **24 CFR § 100.75** — HUD regulations on discriminatory advertisements, statements, and notices
- **24 CFR Part 109** (historical) — HUD's Fair Housing Advertising guidelines (withdrawn from CFR in 1996 but still reflects HUD's position on advertising compliance)

### Truth in Advertising
- **FTC Act, Section 5 (15 U.S.C. § 45)** — Prohibits unfair or deceptive acts or practices in commerce, including real estate advertising
- **Mortgage Acts and Practices — Advertising Rule (MAP Rule), 12 CFR Part 1014** — Bans deceptive representations in mortgage advertising (enforced by CFPB and FTC)
- **Truth in Lending Act (TILA), 15 U.S.C. § 1601 et seq.** — Requires specific disclosures when advertising credit terms
- **Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act (RESPA), 12 U.S.C. § 2601 et seq.** — Prohibits kickbacks and unearned fees, affects how affiliated services are advertised

### Digital Advertising
- **HUD Guidance on Application of the Fair Housing Act to the Advertising of Housing Through Digital Platforms (2024)** — Addresses algorithmic targeting, ad delivery systems, and platform responsibilities
- **CAN-SPAM Act (15 U.S.C. § 7701)** — Applies to commercial email marketing, including real estate

## What It Prohibits

### Fair Housing Advertising Rules

#### The "Ordinary Reader" Standard
All real estate advertising is evaluated under the standard of how an **ordinary reader** would interpret it — not the advertiser's intent. HUD considers whether the language, imagery, or placement of an ad would suggest a preference, limitation, or discrimination based on any protected class.

#### Prohibited Content Categories
Per 24 CFR § 100.75 and HUD guidance, the following are prohibited in all housing advertising:

1. **Words and phrases** that indicate a preference, limitation, or discrimination based on a protected class
2. **Symbols and visual aids** that convey discriminatory preferences (e.g., Confederate flags, religious symbols without disclaimers, racially homogeneous imagery)
3. **Selective geographic targeting** — directing ads only to certain areas based on demographic composition
4. **Selective media placement** — advertising only in media targeting one protected group
5. **Human model selection** — using models that suggest racial or demographic preferences
6. **Directions to property** — using landmarks that signal neighborhood demographics (e.g., directing people via specific cultural or religious landmarks)

#### What IS Required in Advertising
- **Equal Housing Opportunity statement, logo, or slogan** — HUD views its use "with approval"; while not technically mandatory for all ads, its absence can be held against an advertiser in a complaint
- **Publisher notice** — Publications should include a notice stating all housing is available on an equal opportunity basis
- **Agent/broker identification** — State licensing laws require identification of the licensee and brokerage

### Truth in Advertising Rules

#### FTC Requirements
Under Section 5 of the FTC Act, ALL real estate advertising must be:

1. **Truthful** — Claims must be factually accurate
2. **Non-deceptive** — Must not mislead consumers through statements, omissions, or implications
3. **Substantiated** — Factual claims must be backed by evidence
4. **Non-unfair** — Must not cause substantial injury that consumers cannot reasonably avoid

#### Prohibited Deceptive Practices in Real Estate Ads
- **False property descriptions** — Misrepresenting square footage, lot size, number of rooms, condition, or amenities
- **Misleading pricing** — Advertising below-market prices to generate leads with no intention of honoring them (bait-and-switch)
- **Fabricated testimonials** — Fake reviews or endorsements
- **Unsubstantiated claims** — "Best neighborhood in [city]" or "property values guaranteed to increase" without evidence
- **Hidden fees or conditions** — Failing to disclose material costs or restrictions
- **Misleading photography** — Using manipulated images that materially misrepresent the property
- **False urgency** — "Last unit available!" when multiple units remain

#### Mortgage Advertising (MAP Rule)
The MAP Rule specifically prohibits:
- Misrepresenting interest rates, APR, or payment amounts
- Deceptive "no fees" or "no closing costs" claims
- Misleading statements about a consumer's ability to qualify
- False claims about government affiliation or endorsement
- Misrepresenting the availability of loan modification or refinancing

### Digital Platform Advertising

HUD's 2024 guidance on digital advertising clarifies that:
- **Platform operators** share responsibility for discriminatory ad delivery
- **Algorithmic targeting** that has a disparate impact on protected classes violates the FHA, even if the advertiser did not intend discrimination
- **Lookalike audiences** and similar tools must not exclude protected classes from housing ads
- **Ad delivery optimization** that steers housing ads away from protected groups is discriminatory
- **User-selected targeting** that excludes protected classes from housing ads is prohibited

## Why It Matters

### For AI-Generated Advertising
AI-generated real estate advertising faces unique compliance challenges:

1. **AI can reproduce biased language patterns** from training data, generating discriminatory content without human intent
2. **AI does not understand legal nuance** — it may produce language that passes as "marketing copy" but violates the ordinary reader standard
3. **Scale amplifies risk** — AI can generate hundreds of ads quickly, multiplying the impact of any single violation
4. **Accountability remains with the advertiser** — using AI does not create a defense; the party who publishes the ad is liable
5. **Truth claims require verification** — AI may fabricate or embellish property details; all factual claims must be verified against actual property data

### Penalties for Advertising Violations

| Violation Type | Enforcement Agency | Potential Penalties |
|---------------|-------------------|-------------------|
| Fair housing advertising | HUD / DOJ | Up to $25,597 first offense (2024); escalating for repeat |
| Deceptive advertising | FTC / CFPB | Up to $16,000+ per day per violation |
| Mortgage advertising | CFPB / FTC / State AG | Civil penalties, injunctions, restitution |
| State licensing violations | State real estate commission | Fines, license suspension/revocation |
| NAR Code of Ethics | NAR / local board | Fines, membership suspension, expulsion |

## Examples

### Fair Housing Advertising Violations

- **Using only white models in all advertising** — HUD guidance states models should "reasonably represent majority and minority groups"
- **Advertising only in English-language media in a bilingual market** — pattern may indicate national origin targeting
- **Facebook ad targeted to exclude "Hispanic" affinity group** — digital targeting discrimination (see HUD v. Facebook)
- **Listing photos showing only church steeples and no other landmarks** — visual content signaling religious demographics

### Truth in Advertising Violations

- **"Completely renovated!"** (when only the kitchen was updated) — misleading property description
- **"Waterfront property"** (property is across a road from water with no access) — deceptive description
- **"Award-winning schools"** (schools have not received awards) — unsubstantiated claim
- **"Property values have increased 20% year-over-year"** (without data) — unsubstantiated market claim
- **"Will not last — only one unit available!"** (ten units remain) — false urgency
- **"No HOA fees"** (there is an HOA, but the first year is waived) — misleading omission
- **Photos with digitally enhanced landscaping or removed power lines** — misleading visual representation
- **"Minutes from downtown"** (45-minute drive) — misleading proximity claim

### Compliant Advertising Practices

- **"3-bedroom, 2-bath home on 0.5-acre lot"** — factual, verifiable property description
- **"Updated kitchen with granite counters and stainless appliances"** — specific, accurate feature description
- **"Located in [official neighborhood name], [city]"** — factual location
- **"Built in 2018, approximately 2,200 sq ft"** — factual specifications with appropriate hedging
- **"Equal Housing Opportunity" logo or statement included** — compliance best practice
- **"Contact [Agent Name], [Brokerage], License #[number]"** — proper identification
- **Diverse imagery representing the community** — inclusive visual representation
- **"Schedule a showing to see the property in person"** — encourages verification

## Edge Cases

### "Best Neighborhood" / Superlative Claims
Superlatives like "best," "finest," "most desirable" are considered **puffery** — subjective opinions that consumers understand are not factual claims. They are generally permissible under FTC rules. However, in fair housing context, "most desirable neighborhood" can carry discriminatory implications. The safest approach: avoid superlatives about neighborhoods; use them sparingly for property features.

### Virtual Staging and AI-Generated Images
Digitally staging empty rooms or using AI to enhance property photos is becoming common. This is acceptable if:
- It is disclosed that staging is virtual ("virtually staged" disclaimer)
- The digital staging does not materially misrepresent the property's condition
- Structural features are not altered (walls, windows, ceiling height)
- The property's actual condition is available for verification

### "As-Is" Sales
Advertising a property "as-is" does not exempt the seller from disclosure requirements. Known material defects must still be disclosed. "As-is" affects the negotiation of repairs, not the duty to disclose.

### Testimonials and Reviews
- Real testimonials from actual clients are acceptable with proper disclosure
- AI-generated testimonials are deceptive and prohibited
- Cherry-picking only positive reviews while suppressing negative ones may be misleading
- Paid endorsements must be disclosed per FTC guidelines

### Social Media and Informal Advertising
A real estate agent's social media post about a listing is advertising and is subject to all fair housing and truth-in-advertising rules. "Just sharing" does not create an exemption. This includes:
- Instagram/TikTok property tours
- Facebook Marketplace listings
- Twitter/X posts about available properties
- YouTube property videos
- Blog posts about listings

### AI-Generated Ad Copy
When AI generates real estate advertising copy:
- The advertiser (agent/broker) is responsible for compliance
- AI output must be reviewed for discriminatory language before publication
- Factual claims generated by AI must be verified against property data
- "The AI wrote it" is not a defense to a fair housing complaint
