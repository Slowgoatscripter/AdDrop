# Steering

## Law

**Section 804(a) of the Fair Housing Act (42 U.S.C. § 3604(a))** prohibits making housing unavailable or denying housing because of a protected class. **Section 804(c) (42 U.S.C. § 3604(c))** prohibits discriminatory statements in advertising that steer buyers or renters toward or away from particular areas.

**Section 804(d) (42 U.S.C. § 3604(d))** specifically prohibits representing that a dwelling is not available for inspection, sale, or rental when it is in fact available.

HUD regulations at **24 CFR § 100.70** define prohibited steering conduct in detail.

## What It Prohibits

Steering is the practice of influencing a buyer's or renter's housing choice based on a protected class, effectively channeling people toward or away from specific neighborhoods, buildings, or communities. In advertising, steering occurs through language that signals who "belongs" in a particular area.

### Two Elements of a Steering Violation

1. An effort to influence a prospect's choice of housing
2. That effort is related to the prospect's protected class membership

**Intent is not required** — even well-intentioned steering is illegal. A real estate agent directing a Muslim client exclusively to properties near mosques is steering, even if the agent thought they were being helpful.

### How Steering Appears in Advertising

- **Neighborhood demographic descriptions**: Describing the racial, ethnic, religious, or age composition of an area
- **Code words for demographics**: Using proxy language that an ordinary reader would understand as referring to a protected class
- **School quality references**: Describing schools in ways that signal neighborhood racial composition
- **Safety and crime references**: Using "safe area" or "low crime" as proxies for racial demographics
- **Cultural references**: Describing neighborhood culture in ways that indicate who lives there
- **Selective marketing**: Targeting or excluding ads from specific demographic groups
- **Photo selection**: Using images that suggest only one race or type of person lives in the area

## Why It Matters

Steering perpetuates residential segregation — one of the most enduring forms of discrimination in the United States. It denies people the ability to choose where they live based on personal preferences and instead channels them based on identity.

A 2019 Newsday investigation found that **40% of real estate agents** in paired testing on Long Island violated fair housing laws, most often through steering. This demonstrates that steering remains widespread and often unconscious.

### Consequences
- All FHA penalties apply (up to $25,597 first offense, escalating for repeat violations)
- DOJ pattern-and-practice cases can result in penalties up to $150,000
- State licensing boards may suspend or revoke real estate licenses
- Compensatory and punitive damages in private lawsuits
- Required fair housing training and monitoring as part of settlements

## Protected Class(es)

All seven federally protected classes: **Race, Color, Religion, Sex, National Origin, Familial Status, Disability**

Steering most commonly manifests around race, national origin, and familial status, but can affect any protected class.

## Examples

### Violations

- **"Located in a prestigious, exclusive neighborhood"** — "exclusive" is a code word that historically signals racial or socioeconomic exclusion and may be interpreted as expressing a racial preference
- **"Safe, low-crime area perfect for families"** — "safe" and "low-crime" when used to describe neighborhoods can function as coded racial language; pairing with "families" compounds the issue
- **"Great neighborhood — you'll love the local culture and community feel"** — vague cultural references can signal racial or ethnic demographics
- **"Top-rated schools nearby"** — while not per se illegal, school quality references require caution as they can function as proxies for neighborhood racial composition (NAR guidance)
- **"Up-and-coming neighborhood"** — can imply gentrification and signal that the current demographic is changing (racial undertones)
- **"Close to [specific ethnic] restaurants and shops"** — describes neighborhood demographics through cultural references, signaling who lives there
- **"Integrated neighborhood"** or **"diverse community"** — directly references racial composition of the area
- **"Traditional American neighborhood"** — "traditional" and "American" function as code for white, native-born residents
- **"Close-knit community where everyone knows each other"** — can signal homogeneity and discourage outsiders from protected classes
- **"Established neighborhood with long-time residents"** — can imply resistance to demographic change

### Compliant Alternatives

- **"Well-maintained neighborhood"** — describes physical condition, not demographics
- **"Convenient location near shopping, dining, and parks"** — describes amenities without cultural coding
- **"Close to public transportation and major highways"** — objective location benefit
- **"Walkable neighborhood with tree-lined streets"** — physical description of the area
- **"Near schools, parks, and community centers"** — factual proximity to amenities without quality judgments
- **"Quiet residential street"** — describes noise level, not demographics
- **"Minutes from downtown"** — objective geographic fact
- **"Charming historic district"** — describes architecture and history, not people
- **"Growing area with new businesses and amenities"** — describes development without demographic implications
- **"Centrally located with easy access to [city name] attractions"** — geographic fact

## Edge Cases

### School References
Mentioning proximity to schools is generally acceptable ("near schools"). However, describing school quality, rankings, or demographics crosses into steering territory. NAR recommends directing buyers to independently verify school information rather than making quality claims in advertising.

### "Safe Neighborhood" / "Low Crime"
These phrases are problematic because they are frequently used as proxies for racial composition. The safest approach is to omit crime-related language entirely and let buyers research crime statistics independently. If safety features of the property itself are relevant (gated entry, security system), describe the property feature, not the neighborhood.

### Cultural Amenities
Mentioning specific cultural amenities (ethnic restaurants, houses of worship, cultural centers) can constitute steering by signaling who lives in the area. Stick to generic amenity categories: "restaurants," "shopping," "parks."

### "Walkable" and "Bikeable"
These are generally acceptable as they describe infrastructure, not demographics. However, in some contexts they have been associated with gentrification narratives, so use them to describe actual infrastructure features.

### Neighborhood Names
Using established neighborhood names is acceptable. However, using informal names that have racial or ethnic connotations (e.g., nicknames based on the ethnic group living there) constitutes steering.

### Describing Property vs. Neighborhood
The key distinction: **describe the property, not the people.** Physical features of a home, its layout, its amenities — all fine. The composition, culture, or character of the people who live nearby — not fine.
