# Fair Housing Act — Overview

## Law

**The Fair Housing Act (FHA)**, codified at **42 U.S.C. §§ 3601–3619**, was enacted as Title VIII of the Civil Rights Act of 1968. It was substantially amended by the Fair Housing Amendments Act of 1988 (FHAA), which added disability and familial status as protected classes and strengthened enforcement mechanisms.

The advertising-specific prohibition is found in **Section 804(c) (42 U.S.C. § 3604(c))**, which makes it unlawful to:

> "make, print, or publish, or cause to be made, printed, or published any notice, statement, or advertisement, with respect to the sale or rental of a dwelling that indicates any preference, limitation, or discrimination based on race, color, religion, sex, handicap, familial status, or national origin, or an intention to make any such preference, limitation, or discrimination."

HUD's implementing regulations for fair housing advertising are found at **24 CFR Part 109**.

## What It Prohibits

The Fair Housing Act prohibits discrimination in the sale, rental, and financing of housing based on seven federally protected classes:

1. **Race**
2. **Color**
3. **Religion**
4. **Sex** (including sexual orientation and gender identity per HUD guidance and the Supreme Court's *Bostock v. Clayton County* reasoning)
5. **National Origin**
6. **Familial Status** (families with children under 18, pregnant women, people in the process of securing custody)
7. **Disability** (physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more major life activities)

### Specific Prohibited Acts in Advertising

Under Section 804(c), it is illegal to:

- Use words, phrases, symbols, or visual aids that convey a preference for or against any protected class
- Use selective media placement to exclude protected groups from seeing housing advertisements
- Describe current or potential residents in terms of protected characteristics
- Describe the neighborhood or area in terms that indicate a preference for a protected class
- Use human models in advertising that suggest a racial preference through size or placement

**The standard is "ordinary reader" — if a reasonable person would interpret the ad as expressing a preference, limitation, or discrimination, it violates the law. Intent does not matter.**

## Why It Matters

### For Real Estate Professionals
- **First violation**: Civil penalties up to **$25,597** (2024 adjusted amount per 24 CFR § 180.671)
- **Repeat violation within 5 years**: Up to **$63,991**
- **Two or more violations within 7 years**: Up to **$127,983**
- **DOJ-brought cases**: Civil penalties up to **$150,000**
- Additional compensatory and punitive damages with no statutory cap
- Attorney's fees and court costs
- License suspension or revocation by state licensing boards
- Reputational damage and loss of business

### For Those Experiencing Discrimination
The FHA protects anyone seeking to buy, rent, or finance housing. Victims of discrimination can file complaints with HUD (within 1 year) or file federal lawsuits (within 2 years) and may recover:
- Actual damages (out-of-pocket costs, emotional distress)
- Punitive damages
- Injunctive relief
- Attorney's fees

### Why Advertising Compliance Is Critical
Advertising violations are among the most commonly filed fair housing complaints because:
- Ads create a written record that is easy to evaluate
- The "ordinary reader" standard does not require proof of discriminatory intent
- A single ad can affect an entire class of people
- HUD and fair housing organizations actively monitor real estate advertising
- Social media and digital advertising have expanded scrutiny (see HUD's 2024 guidance on digital advertising platforms)

## Protected Classes — Detailed

| Class | What It Covers | Common Ad Violations |
|-------|---------------|---------------------|
| **Race** | All racial groups | "Caucasian neighborhood," racial demographics of area |
| **Color** | Skin color distinctions | "Light-skinned preferred," color-coded language |
| **Religion** | All religions and non-religion | "Near Christian church," "Jewish neighborhood," "Muslim-free" |
| **Sex** | Gender, sexual orientation, gender identity | "Female roommate wanted" (exemptions exist for shared living), "traditional family values" as code |
| **National Origin** | Country of birth, ancestry, culture, language | "English speakers only," "American-born," ethnic food references to describe neighborhoods |
| **Familial Status** | Families with children under 18, pregnancy | "No children," "adult community" (unless qualifying as 55+ housing), "quiet professionals" |
| **Disability** | Physical, mental, sensory impairments | "No wheelchairs," "must be able to climb stairs," "no mentally ill" |

## Exemptions (Narrow)

The FHA has limited exemptions, but **Section 804(c) advertising restrictions have NO exemptions**:

- **Owner-occupied buildings with 4 or fewer units** ("Mrs. Murphy exemption") — exempt from some FHA provisions but **NOT from advertising restrictions**
- **Single-family homes sold by owner without a broker** — exempt from some provisions but **NOT from advertising restrictions**
- **Religious organizations and private clubs** — may limit occupancy to members but **CANNOT discriminate in advertising based on race, color, or national origin**
- **Housing for Older Persons (HOPA)** — 55+ communities may exclude families with children if they meet specific HUD requirements (80% occupancy by 55+ residents)

**Key takeaway: Even when a housing transaction is exempt from the FHA, discriminatory advertising is NEVER exempt.**

## Coverage — What Counts as Advertising

Fair housing advertising provisions apply to ALL forms of housing advertising:

- MLS listings and descriptions
- Print ads (newspapers, magazines, flyers, brochures)
- Digital ads (websites, social media, email campaigns)
- Radio and television advertisements
- Signs and billboards
- Direct mail campaigns
- Open house materials
- Virtual tours and video content
- AI-generated ad copy and descriptions
- Any verbal or written statement about housing availability

## The "Ordinary Reader" Standard

HUD evaluates advertising under the **"ordinary reader" test**: Would an ordinary reader or listener, without any special knowledge, understand the advertisement to express a preference, limitation, or discrimination based on a protected class?

This means:
- **Intent is irrelevant** — an ad can violate the FHA even if no discrimination was intended
- **Context matters** — the same word may be acceptable in one context but discriminatory in another
- **Code words count** — phrases that serve as proxies for protected classes are treated the same as explicit discrimination
- **Omissions can violate** — selectively omitting information available to other groups is discriminatory
- **Cumulative effect** — a pattern of seemingly neutral language that consistently discourages protected classes can constitute a violation
