# Sex and Gender

## Law

**Section 804(c) of the Fair Housing Act (42 U.S.C. § 3604(c))** prohibits advertising that indicates a preference, limitation, or discrimination based on sex.

Sex has been a protected class since the **original Fair Housing Act of 1968**.

### Expansion to Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity

- **Bostock v. Clayton County, 590 U.S. 644 (2020)** — The Supreme Court held that discrimination "because of sex" under Title VII (employment) necessarily includes discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity
- **Executive Order 13988 (January 20, 2021)** — Directed federal agencies, including HUD, to apply the Bostock reasoning to all federal sex discrimination laws, including the Fair Housing Act
- **HUD Memorandum (February 11, 2021)** — HUD's Office of General Counsel concluded that the FHA's sex discrimination provisions are "comparable to those of Title VII" and likewise prohibit discrimination because of sexual orientation and gender identity
- **24 CFR Part 5, Subpart A (Equal Access Rule)** — Requires equal access to HUD-funded and HUD-insured housing regardless of sexual orientation, gender identity, or marital status

## What It Prohibits

### In Advertising

It is illegal to use language, imagery, or descriptions in housing advertising that:

- Express a preference for tenants or buyers of a particular sex or gender
- Exclude or discourage persons based on sex, gender identity, or sexual orientation
- Use gendered language that indicates who the ideal tenant or buyer should be
- Use stereotyped descriptions that signal gender preferences
- Describe the property in terms of its suitability for one gender over another
- Express preferences related to sexual orientation or gender identity
- Use "traditional family" language as a proxy for heterosexual couples

### Coverage

Under current HUD interpretation, "sex" in the FHA covers:
- **Biological sex** — male, female
- **Sexual orientation** — heterosexual, homosexual, bisexual
- **Gender identity** — cisgender, transgender, non-binary
- **Sex stereotyping** — assumptions about how people of a particular sex should behave or present
- **Sexual harassment** — unwelcome sexual conduct in housing contexts

## Why It Matters

### Scope of Impact
- As many as **1 in 5 transgender people** have faced discrimination when seeking housing (National Center for Transgender Equality)
- A **2014 HUD paired testing study** found that heterosexual couples were favored over same-sex couples by **16 percent** in tests of housing providers
- Single women face documented discrimination in rental and mortgage markets
- Sex-based discrimination in housing advertising perpetuates gendered housing patterns

### Legal Landscape
- While the Bostock reasoning has been applied to fair housing by HUD, the Supreme Court has not directly ruled on its application to the FHA
- Many states, including Montana (under the Montana Human Rights Act), independently protect sex as a class, and some states have explicit sexual orientation and gender identity protections
- The legal landscape continues to evolve; the safest approach is to treat sexual orientation and gender identity as protected

### Consequences
- Full FHA penalty structure applies
- State and local nondiscrimination laws may provide additional penalties
- Sexual harassment in housing contexts can result in significant compensatory and punitive damages
- Pattern-and-practice cases brought by DOJ can result in systemic reforms

## Protected Class(es)

**Sex** — biological sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, gender expression, sex stereotyping

## Examples

### Violations

- **"Female tenants only"** or **"males preferred"** — explicit sex-based preference (note: limited shared-living exemptions may apply to roommate situations, but advertising restrictions still generally apply)
- **"Perfect for a single woman"** — expresses a sex-based preference for who should live there
- **"Bachelor pad"** — implies the property is intended for men
- **"Man cave included"** — while describing a room, it genders the property and its intended occupant
- **"Traditional families welcome"** — functions as code excluding LGBTQ families and non-traditional household structures
- **"Ideal for a young couple" (with heterosexual imagery)** — combines sex stereotyping with exclusive imagery
- **"Straight tenants preferred"** — explicit sexual orientation discrimination
- **"No transgenders"** — explicit gender identity discrimination
- **"Real men's neighborhood"** — sex stereotyping
- **"She-shed in the backyard"** — while sometimes used humorously, it genders a property feature and implies a preferred occupant
- **"Looking for a good Christian husband and wife"** — combines sex, religion, and marital status preferences
- **"Ladies' building — quiet and refined"** — explicit sex preference combined with stereotyping
- **"Normal couples only"** — implies non-heterosexual couples are abnormal
- **"Family-oriented community — married couples preferred"** — combines familial status and sex/marital status preferences

### Compliant Alternatives

- **"One-bedroom apartment available"** — describes the property without gendering
- **"Bonus room / flex space in basement"** — describes a room's utility without gendering
- **"Quiet community with maintained grounds"** — neutral lifestyle description
- **"Updated kitchen with modern finishes"** — describes property features
- **"Spacious studio apartment in downtown [city]"** — neutral property description
- **"Two-car garage with workshop space"** — describes a feature without gendering
- **"All are welcome — equal housing opportunity"** — inclusive, legally compliant statement
- **"Cozy retreat with fireplace and deck"** — describes ambiance without targeting a gender
- **"Open floor plan ideal for entertaining"** — describes functionality neutrally
- **"Private entrance with dedicated parking"** — describes features

## Edge Cases

### Roommate Situations
The FHA has a limited exemption for roommate selection in shared living spaces (the "Mrs. Murphy exemption" under § 3603(b)). Courts have recognized some First Amendment protections for personal roommate preferences. However:
- **Advertising a rental unit** (even in a shared home) should avoid sex-based language
- **Personal roommate selection** (sharing your own living space) has more legal flexibility
- Platforms like Craigslist and others have specific policies on how roommate preferences can be stated
- The safest approach in AI-generated advertising: never use sex-based preferences

### "Master Bedroom" / "Master Suite"
These terms are **legally acceptable** under fair housing law. While some industry members have moved toward alternatives like "primary bedroom" for cultural sensitivity reasons, HUD has not identified these terms as fair housing violations.

### "His and Hers Closets"
This is **borderline**. While describing a property feature, it reinforces heteronormative assumptions. The compliant alternative is "dual closets" or "two walk-in closets." For AI-generated ads, prefer the gender-neutral alternative.

### "Mother-in-Law Suite" / "In-Law Apartment"
These are **generally acceptable** as established real estate terminology describing a specific type of unit (self-contained living space within a larger property). However, alternatives like "guest suite" or "accessory dwelling unit" are increasingly preferred.

### Gendered Property Descriptions
Real estate has traditionally used gendered language to market properties: "This home has great curb appeal that will make her fall in love" or "The garage workshop is every man's dream." These gendered marketing approaches violate fair housing advertising rules by expressing sex-based preferences about who should purchase or rent the property.

### LGBTQ-Affirming Language
Using inclusive language like "LGBTQ-friendly" or displaying a rainbow flag is **not** a fair housing violation — expressing inclusion does not constitute discrimination against others. However, AI-generated ads should focus on property features rather than making identity-based appeals in either direction.

### Sexual Harassment in Advertising
While less common, advertising that contains sexual content, innuendo, or that sexualizes the property or its potential occupants can constitute sex-based discrimination. Professional advertising should maintain appropriate boundaries.

### "Couples Only" or "Married Couples Preferred"
These phrases discriminate on the basis of sex (by implying heterosexual couples), familial status (by excluding single parents), and potentially marital status (where protected by state law). Avoid entirely.
