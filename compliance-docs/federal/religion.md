# Religion

## Law

**Section 804(c) of the Fair Housing Act (42 U.S.C. § 3604(c))** prohibits advertising that indicates a preference, limitation, or discrimination based on religion.

Religion has been a protected class since the **original Fair Housing Act of 1968**.

HUD advertising regulations: **24 CFR Part 109** and **24 CFR § 100.75**

### Limited Religious Organization Exemption

**42 U.S.C. § 3607(a)** provides a narrow exemption: Religious organizations and private clubs may limit the sale, rental, or occupancy of dwellings they own or operate for noncommercial purposes to persons of the same religion or club membership, provided membership is not restricted on account of race, color, or national origin.

**However, the advertising exemption does NOT allow discriminatory advertising based on race, color, or national origin, even by exempt religious organizations.**

## What It Prohibits

### In Advertising

It is illegal to use language, imagery, or descriptions in housing advertising that:

- Express a preference for tenants or buyers of a particular religion
- Exclude or discourage persons of a particular religion (or no religion) from applying
- Describe the religious composition of a neighborhood or building
- Use religious symbols or imagery in a way that indicates a religious preference for housing (unless with a proper disclaimer by a religious organization)
- Reference proximity to specific houses of worship in a way that signals a preferred religious demographic

### What Counts as Religious Discrimination in Advertising

- Explicit religious preferences or exclusions ("Christians only," "no Muslims")
- Describing tenants, owners, or neighborhoods in religious terms ("Jewish home," "Catholic building")
- Using religious landmarks as neighborhood character signals (as opposed to simple proximity references)
- Religious imagery without disclaimer that could signal a preference
- Advertising exclusively in media that targets one religious group without reaching others

## Why It Matters

### Scope of Protection
- Religion covers all faiths, denominations, sects, and the absence of religious belief (atheism, agnosticism)
- Protects against discrimination by landlords, sellers, agents, and advertisers regardless of their own religious beliefs
- Applies to all housing advertising nationwide, with no exemptions for advertising content

### Real-World Impact
- Religious minorities face documented housing discrimination, particularly Muslim, Jewish, Sikh, and Hindu communities
- Post-9/11, housing discrimination complaints based on religion and national origin increased significantly
- Subtle religious signals in advertising can create environments where certain groups feel unwelcome
- Religious discrimination in housing perpetuates residential segregation along faith lines

### Consequences
- Full FHA penalty structure applies (up to $25,597 first offense, escalating)
- Religious organizations that exceed their exemption face full liability
- State laws may add additional protections beyond federal requirements

## Protected Class(es)

**Religion** — all religions, denominations, sects, and absence of religion

## Examples

### Violations

- **"Christian home" or "Jewish residence"** — describes the property or current owner/tenant in religious terms, expressing a preference
- **"No Muslims"** — explicit religious exclusion
- **"Catholic tenants preferred"** — explicit religious preference
- **"Near beautiful church — perfect for devout families"** — pairs proximity to a religious landmark with a religious descriptor, expressing a preference for Christian tenants
- **"Located in a Jewish neighborhood"** — describes the neighborhood by its religious demographics
- **"Temple within walking distance — ideal for observant families"** — signals preference for Jewish tenants by pairing a religious landmark with a religious lifestyle descriptor
- **"Bible Belt community values"** — signals a preference for Christian tenants
- **"Faith-based community"** — implies that religious belief is expected or preferred
- **"Perfect for a God-fearing family"** — expresses a religious preference
- **"No Scientologists" or "no atheists"** — explicit exclusion based on religious belief or non-belief
- **"Kosher kitchen — Jewish tenants only"** — while a kosher kitchen is a factual feature, restricting it to Jewish tenants is discriminatory
- **"Christmas-loving neighborhood"** — associates the neighborhood with a Christian celebration, signaling religious demographics

### Compliant Alternatives

- **"Near houses of worship"** — generic proximity reference that does not signal a preference for any religion
- **"Kosher kitchen available"** — describes a property feature without indicating who should use it
- **"Community room available for resident events"** — neutral amenity description
- **"Located in historic downtown [city name]"** — uses geographic reference, not religious demographics
- **"Close to cultural centers, shops, and restaurants"** — generic amenity proximity
- **"Warm and welcoming community"** — describes the social environment without religious reference
- **"Merry Christmas" or "Happy Hanukkah" in seasonal advertising** — holiday greetings are acceptable (HUD guidance); they do not express a housing preference
- **"Property features updated kitchen with gas range"** — describes features neutrally
- **"Quiet street near parks and schools"** — neutral neighborhood description

## Edge Cases

### Holiday Greetings in Advertising
HUD has stated that phrases like **"Merry Christmas"** and **"Happy Easter"** in advertising are **acceptable** and do not constitute religious discrimination. These are considered general cultural greetings rather than expressions of religious preference for housing. Similarly, "Happy Hanukkah," "Ramadan Mubarak," or "Happy Diwali" would be acceptable holiday greetings.

### "Kosher" Amenities
Describing a kitchen as "kosher" or mentioning kosher meal services is **acceptable** as a factual property feature. It becomes problematic only if combined with language restricting the property to Jewish residents. Similarly, "halal kitchen" as a feature description is fine.

### Proximity to Houses of Worship
The key distinction:
- **Acceptable**: "Near houses of worship" or "Walking distance to church, synagogue, and mosque" (generic, inclusive)
- **Problematic**: "Steps from St. Mary's — perfect for Catholic families" (pairs a specific house of worship with a religious descriptor indicating preference)
- **Borderline**: "Near St. Mary's Church" (factual proximity to a named landmark — generally acceptable if not combined with preference language)

### Entity Names with Religious References
If a property is operated by a religious organization (e.g., "St. Mary's Apartments" or "Beth Israel Senior Living"), the religious name itself is not discriminatory, but advertising should include the **Fair Housing disclaimer**: "This property does not discriminate on the basis of race, color, religion, national origin, sex, handicap, or familial status." This clarifies that the religious name does not indicate a religious preference for tenants.

### Religious Organization Exemption
Under § 3607(a), a church that owns a non-commercial apartment building may prefer members of its congregation. However:
- This exemption does **not** apply to commercially operated housing
- The advertising for such housing still cannot discriminate based on race, color, or national origin
- The exemption is narrow and rarely applies to typical real estate transactions
- When in doubt, do not rely on this exemption in advertising

### "Family Values" and Cultural Signaling
Phrases like "traditional family values," "wholesome community," and "moral living" can function as code for religious (usually conservative Christian) preferences. While not explicitly religious, they signal a religious demographic and may be interpreted as expressing a preference.

### Advertising Media Selection
Advertising exclusively in a single religious publication (e.g., only in a church newsletter) without also advertising in general-circulation media may indicate discriminatory targeting. Best practice: advertise broadly, and if religious media is used, ensure general-circulation media is also included.
