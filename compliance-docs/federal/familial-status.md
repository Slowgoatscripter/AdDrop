# Familial Status

## Law

**Section 804(c) of the Fair Housing Act (42 U.S.C. § 3604(c))** prohibits discriminatory advertising based on familial status. Familial status was added as a protected class by the **Fair Housing Amendments Act of 1988 (FHAA)**.

The **Housing for Older Persons Act of 1995 (HOPA) (Pub. L. 104-76)** narrowed the exemption for senior housing, eliminating the "significant facilities and services" requirement for 55+ communities.

HUD regulations implementing familial status protections are found at **24 CFR §§ 100.65–100.70**. The Housing for Older Persons exemption is detailed at **24 CFR Part 100, Subpart E (§§ 100.300–100.314)**.

## What It Prohibits

It is illegal to advertise housing in any way that indicates a preference against — or a limitation excluding — families with children. This includes:

- Stating that children are not allowed or not welcome
- Using language that implies the housing is only for adults, singles, or couples without children
- Imposing occupancy standards in advertising that disproportionately exclude families (e.g., "one person per bedroom")
- Suggesting that the property or neighborhood is inappropriate for children
- Using age-based language that signals children are unwelcome
- Advertising amenities or lifestyle descriptions designed to discourage families

### Who Is Protected

"Familial status" under the FHA means:
- One or more individuals under 18 living with a parent or legal guardian
- Anyone in the process of securing legal custody of a child under 18
- Pregnant women
- The designee of the parent or custodian (with written permission)

### The 55+ Exemption (HOPA)

Housing qualifies as "Housing for Older Persons" and is exempt from familial status protections ONLY if it meets one of three criteria:

1. **Government-designated elderly housing**: Specifically designed for and occupied by elderly persons under a federal, state, or local government program
2. **62+ housing**: 100% occupied by persons 62 years of age or older
3. **55+ housing**: At least 80% of occupied units have at least one resident 55 or older, AND the community publishes and adheres to policies demonstrating intent to be 55+ housing, AND complies with HUD verification requirements

**Even qualifying 55+ communities must use proper terminology in advertising** — "55 and older community" or "senior housing" is preferred. "Adults only" or "no children" is discouraged even for qualifying communities because it sends a message inconsistent with the HOPA intent requirement.

## Why It Matters

Familial status discrimination in advertising is one of the most common fair housing violations because many housing providers and agents use exclusionary language without realizing it violates the law.

### Real-World Impact
- Families with children are denied access to housing they could otherwise afford
- Single parents (disproportionately women) face compounded discrimination
- Children experience instability and educational disruption when housing options are artificially limited
- Concentrating families in limited housing options perpetuates poverty and overcrowding

### Enforcement Examples
- A Massachusetts landlord was required to include "children welcome" in all future advertising after using exclusionary language
- Property management companies have paid thousands in settlements for using "adults only" in ads
- HUD has required fair housing training and monitoring periods in settlements involving familial status advertising violations

## Protected Class(es)

**Familial Status** — families with children under 18, pregnant women, persons securing legal custody of children

## Examples

### Violations

- **"No children"** — explicitly excludes families with children; clear Section 804(c) violation
- **"Adults only"** — directly states children are not welcome; violates familial status protections (even in 55+ communities, this phrasing is discouraged by HUD)
- **"Perfect for singles or couples"** — implies families with children are not the target market and would not be welcome
- **"Ideal for mature adults"** — "mature adults" signals that children and families are unwelcome
- **"Quiet adult living"** — combines age preference with lifestyle description that excludes families
- **"No kids allowed"** — explicit exclusion of children
- **"Couples preferred"** — implies preference against families with children
- **"Not suitable for children"** — direct statement discouraging families
- **"Limit 2 persons per unit"** — occupancy restriction that disproportionately affects families (though reasonable occupancy standards based on unit size are permissible under the Keating Memo)
- **"Senior lifestyle community"** — unless the property legally qualifies under HOPA, this implies children are excluded
- **"Child-free environment"** — explicit exclusion of families with children
- **"Professional tenants only"** — functions as a proxy for "no children/families" in context
- **"Seeking quiet, responsible tenants"** — "quiet" combined with "responsible" can imply children (who are noisy) are unwelcome
- **"Prefer tenants who work 9-5"** — signals preference for childless adults with traditional work schedules
- **"No play areas on property"** — while describing a property feature, emphasizing the absence of child-oriented amenities signals children are unwelcome

### Compliant Alternatives

- **"Two-bedroom apartment available"** — describes the property without indicating who should live there
- **"Spacious home with large backyard"** — describes property features neutrally; families may find this appealing but it does not exclude anyone
- **"Close to parks and schools"** — factual proximity information; does not express a preference
- **"Open floor plan with plenty of natural light"** — describes physical features
- **"Cozy one-bedroom unit"** — describes the property; a small unit naturally limits occupancy without discriminatory language
- **"Community amenities include pool, gym, and walking trails"** — describes amenities available to all residents
- **"Well-maintained property in a residential area"** — neutral description
- **"Quiet residential street"** — describes the street, not who should live there
- **"Modern kitchen with updated appliances"** — describes the property
- **"55 and older community" / "Senior housing"** — acceptable ONLY for properties that legally qualify under HOPA; use specific age language rather than "adults only"

## Edge Cases

### Occupancy Standards
Landlords may establish reasonable occupancy standards (e.g., HUD's guideline of two persons per bedroom as a starting point, per the "Keating Memo" of 1991). However, advertising strict per-unit limits designed to exclude families violates the FHA. The key is whether the standard is based on legitimate factors (building codes, septic capacity, unit size) or is a pretext for excluding children.

### "Family-Friendly" Language
Describing a property as "family-friendly" is **not** a violation — it does not exclude anyone. However, the absence of such language should not be interpreted as exclusionary either. Agents should describe properties based on their features, not the type of family they envision living there.

### "Quiet Community" or "Peaceful Living"
These phrases alone are borderline. They become problematic when combined with other signals (adult-focused imagery, no mention of family amenities, proximity to schools omitted). In isolation, describing a peaceful environment is acceptable. In a pattern of exclusionary messaging, they reinforce the impression that children are unwelcome.

### Studio and One-Bedroom Units
It is acceptable to describe the size and layout of a unit accurately. A one-bedroom or studio apartment naturally limits occupancy. The violation occurs when the ad adds unnecessary language suggesting that small households are preferred: "Perfect for a single professional" crosses the line; "Studio apartment, 400 sq ft" does not.

### Pool and Amenity Rules
Advertising pool hours or rules ("pool closes at 9 PM," "no diving") is acceptable. Advertising "adult swim only" times or "no children in the pool" is problematic in advertising, even if the property has legitimate safety rules that are communicated during tenancy.

### Short-Term Rentals and Vacation Properties
The FHA applies to "dwellings." Some short-term rentals may not qualify, but when advertising residential rental housing, familial status protections apply regardless of lease term.
