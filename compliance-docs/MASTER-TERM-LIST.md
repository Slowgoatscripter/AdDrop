## How to Use This List

### For AI Compliance Engine
1. **Hard violations** should trigger automatic blocking or replacement
2. **Soft violations** should trigger warnings and suggested alternatives
3. Terms should be matched with context awareness (e.g., "exclusive" is fine in "exclusive listing agreement" but problematic in "exclusive neighborhood")
4. Compound phrase detection is critical (individual words may be fine; combinations may violate)

### For Human Review
1. Use this list as a reference when reviewing AI-generated ad copy
2. Pay special attention to Montana-specific terms that go beyond federal requirements
3. Remember that this list is not exhaustive — new coded language emerges regularly
4. When in doubt, apply the "ordinary reader" test: Would a reasonable person interpret this as expressing a preference about WHO should live here?
