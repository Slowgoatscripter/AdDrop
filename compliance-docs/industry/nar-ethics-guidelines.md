# NAR Code of Ethics — Fair Housing and Advertising Guidelines

## Law / Authority

The **National Association of REALTORS (NAR) Code of Ethics** is a self-regulatory standard that applies to all NAR members (approximately 1.5 million REALTORS in the United States). While not "law" in the statutory sense, it is enforceable through NAR's Professional Standards process and can result in fines, suspension, or expulsion from NAR membership.

Key provisions:
- **Article 10** — Core fair housing and nondiscrimination article
- **Standard of Practice 10-1** — Prohibits discriminatory advertising
- **Standard of Practice 10-3** — Prohibits discriminatory conduct in services
- **Standard of Practice 10-5** — Prohibits hate speech, harassing speech, epithets, and slurs (amended June 5, 2025)
- **Professional Standards Policy Statement #29** — Guidance on application of Article 10
- **Article 12** — Truthful advertising and accurate representation

The NAR Code of Ethics **goes beyond federal law** in its protected classes, adding **sexual orientation** and **gender identity** to the list of protected categories.

## What It Prohibits

### Article 10 — Nondiscrimination

> "REALTORS shall not deny equal professional services to any person for reasons of race, color, religion, sex, handicap, familial status, national origin, sexual orientation, or gender identity. REALTORS shall not be parties to any plan or agreement to discriminate against a person or persons on the basis of race, color, religion, sex, handicap, familial status, national origin, sexual orientation, or gender identity."

### NAR Protected Classes (Broader Than Federal FHA)

| Protected Class | Federal FHA | NAR Code |
|----------------|-------------|----------|
| Race | Yes | Yes |
| Color | Yes | Yes |
| Religion | Yes | Yes |
| Sex | Yes | Yes |
| National Origin | Yes | Yes |
| Familial Status | Yes | Yes |
| Disability (Handicap) | Yes | Yes |
| **Sexual Orientation** | HUD interpretation only | **Explicit** |
| **Gender Identity** | HUD interpretation only | **Explicit** |

### Standard of Practice 10-1 — Advertising Prohibition

REALTORS shall not print, display, or circulate any statement or advertisement with respect to selling or renting of a property that indicates any preference, limitation, or discrimination based on any protected class.

This applies to:
- MLS listings and property descriptions
- Print and digital advertising
- Social media posts about properties
- Open house materials
- Brochures, flyers, and direct mail
- Email marketing
- Website listings
- Video content and virtual tours

### Standard of Practice 10-3 — Services

REALTORS shall not:
- Provide different levels of service based on protected class
- Steer clients based on protected class
- Fail to present all properties that meet a client's criteria regardless of neighborhood demographics
- Make demographic statements about neighborhoods

### Standard of Practice 10-5 — Discriminatory Speech (Amended June 2025)

REALTORS, in their capacity as real estate professionals, in association with their real estate businesses, or in their real estate-related activities, shall not:
- Use **harassing speech** based on a protected class
- Use **hate speech** based on a protected class
- Use **epithets** based on a protected class
- Use **slurs** based on a protected class

The June 2025 amendments:
- Created a more specific definition of "harassment" aligned with the NAR Member Code of Conduct
- Focused application on professional capacity and real estate-related activities
- Clarified the scope to prevent overbroad application while maintaining strong protections

### Article 12 — Truthful Advertising

REALTORS shall be honest and truthful in their real estate communications and present a true picture in their advertising, marketing, and other representations. This includes:
- No exaggeration or misrepresentation of property features
- No misleading photography or virtual staging without disclosure
- No deceptive pricing or availability claims
- No fabricated testimonials or endorsements
- Accurate representation of licensure and professional credentials

### Demographic Information (Standard of Practice 10-5, Appendix XII)

When not involved in the sale or lease of a residence, REALTORS may provide demographic information ONLY if:
- The information is needed to assist with or complete a transaction
- It is obtained from a **recognized, reliable, independent, and impartial source**
- The source and any modifications are disclosed in reasonable detail
- The provision is consistent with Article 10's nondiscrimination principles

In practice, this means: **Never include demographic information in advertising or property descriptions.** Demographic data may only be provided in limited professional contexts with proper sourcing and disclosure.

## Why It Matters

### Beyond Legal Compliance
The NAR Code of Ethics represents **industry best practices** that often exceed legal requirements:
- Legal compliance is the floor; ethical compliance is the standard
- NAR standards can be stricter than what the law requires
- Ethical violations can result in professional consequences even without legal liability

### Enforcement
- **NAR Professional Standards process** — complaints filed through local boards
- **Penalties**: Fines, mandatory education, letters of warning, probation, suspension, or expulsion from NAR
- **Local board enforcement** — local boards investigate and adjudicate complaints
- **State licensing implications** — NAR ethics violations can trigger state licensing board investigations
- **MLS access** — loss of NAR membership may result in loss of MLS access

### For AI-Generated Advertising
AI-generated real estate ads used by NAR members must comply with the Code of Ethics:
- The REALTOR is responsible for all advertising, including AI-generated content
- AI output must be reviewed for compliance before publication
- Using AI does not create a defense to an ethics complaint
- AI-generated content must meet Article 12's truthfulness standards

## Protected Class(es)

Per NAR Code of Ethics Article 10: **Race, Color, Religion, Sex, Handicap (Disability), Familial Status, National Origin, Sexual Orientation, Gender Identity**

## Examples

### Violations of NAR Ethics

- **"Traditional family home in a Christian neighborhood"** — violates Article 10 (religion, familial status) and Standard of Practice 10-1 (discriminatory advertising)
- **"Great for straight couples"** — violates Article 10 (sexual orientation, sex)
- **MLS listing: "Charming home in an upscale, exclusive area"** — "exclusive" has discriminatory connotations; violates Standard of Practice 10-1
- **Agent social media post: "Just listed! This home is perfect for a young family"** — familial status and age preference; violates Standard of Practice 10-1
- **Using only photos of white residents in marketing materials** — violates HUD human model guidelines and Article 10 spirit
- **"5-star school district!"** — while not per se a violation, school ratings as a selling point can function as steering and should be handled with caution per NAR guidance
- **Exaggerating square footage in a listing** — violates Article 12 (truthful representation)
- **Claiming "waterfront" when property has no water access** — violates Article 12
- **Using AI to generate fake client testimonials** — violates Article 12

### NAR-Compliant Practices

- **"3-bed, 2-bath home at 123 Main St, [City], [State]"** — factual property description
- **"Spacious kitchen with granite counters, stainless appliances"** — specific, verifiable features
- **Including Equal Housing Opportunity logo** — best practice per NAR and HUD
- **"Please contact [Agent Name] at [Brokerage] for more information"** — proper professional identification
- **"Virtual staging — furniture shown is for illustration only"** — proper disclosure
- **"All measurements are approximate — buyer to verify"** — appropriate hedging
- **"Open house Saturday 1-4 PM — all welcome"** — inclusive language
- **Diverse imagery in marketing materials** — reflects community demographics

## Edge Cases

### Social Media as Advertising
Every social media post by a REALTOR about a property is advertising and is subject to the Code of Ethics. This includes:
- Instagram stories and reels
- Facebook posts and Marketplace listings
- TikTok property tours
- X/Twitter posts
- LinkedIn property shares

There is no "casual posting" exemption for real estate professionals.

### "Pocket Listings" and Selective Marketing
Marketing a listing to a select group rather than the broad market raises Article 10 concerns if the selectivity correlates with protected classes. NAR's Clear Cooperation Policy also addresses this.

### School District Information
NAR recommends that agents exercise caution when discussing school quality. The recommended approach:
- Provide the school district name and direct buyers to independent research
- Do not rate or rank schools in advertising
- Do not use school quality as a selling point that could function as steering

### AI-Generated Content Responsibility
Under Article 12 and Article 10:
- The REALTOR who publishes the ad is responsible, not the AI
- All AI-generated factual claims must be independently verified
- AI-generated language must be reviewed for discriminatory content
- "The AI generated it" is not a defense to an ethics complaint

### Market Data and Pricing Claims
Article 12 requires that pricing claims be substantiated:
- "Below market value" requires comparable data
- "Priced to sell" is acceptable as puffery
- "Best deal in [area]" requires substantiation
- CMA data should support pricing representations
