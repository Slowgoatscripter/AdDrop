# Instagram Real Estate Ad Copy Guide

## Platform Overview

Instagram is a visual-first platform where the image does the heavy lifting and copy plays a supporting role. Your words must complement the visual, not compete with it. The first line of your caption is everything — it determines whether someone taps "more" or keeps scrolling.

---

## Format Constraints

| Element | Limit | Notes |
|---------|-------|-------|
| Caption | 2,200 characters max | Only first ~125 characters show before "more" |
| Truncation point | ~125 characters | This is your hook — treat it as the ad |
| Hashtags | 30 max allowed | 15-20 recommended for reach |
| Line breaks | Supported | Use them to create visual breathing room |
| Links in caption | Not clickable | Direct to "link in bio" instead |
| Story text | ~150 characters visible | Keep it under 100 for readability over images |
| Reel captions | Same as feed | But even fewer people read them — front-load value |

### The 125-Character Rule

Instagram truncates your caption after approximately 125 characters with a "... more" prompt. Everything above that fold must:

1. Hook the reader with a compelling opening
2. Communicate the core value proposition
3. Create enough curiosity to tap "more"

Think of the first 125 characters as your billboard. The rest is the brochure they pick up after they're interested.

## Best Practices

### 1. Hook in the First Line

The first line must stop the scroll. On Instagram, you're competing with friends, food, and entertainment — not just other listings. Your opening line needs to earn attention.

**Effective hook patterns:**
- **Address + standout feature**: "123 Oak Lane — the backyard you've been dreaming about."
- **Question**: "What does $350K buy in Bozeman right now?"
- **Bold claim**: "The best view in Missoula just hit the market."
- **Lifestyle lead**: "Morning coffee with mountain views. Every. Single. Day."
- **Price anchor**: "Under $400K in this neighborhood? Here's how."

### 2. Structure Your Caption

Break your caption into scannable sections:

```
[Hook line — under 125 chars]

[2-3 sentences about the property's story or lifestyle]

[Key features as short lines or light bullet points]

[Call to action]

[Hashtags — separated by spacing or in a comment]
```

### 3. Emoji Usage — Strategic, Not Excessive

Emojis serve as visual anchors that help readers scan. Use them purposefully.

**Do this:**
- Use 1-2 emojis per section as visual markers
- Match emoji to content (house for property, pin for location, key for availability)
- Use them at the start of feature lines for scannability

**Not this:**
- Every sentence ending with an emoji
- Strings of emojis (never use three or more in a row)
- Random emojis that don't match the content
- Emoji in the hook line (it cheapens the opening)

**Acceptable emoji vocabulary for real estate:**
- Property: house, key, door, building
- Features: bed, bath/shower, car, tree, sun, mountain, water
- Location: pin/map pin, compass
- Action: pointing hand, phone, link, arrow
- Status: sparkle (new/renovated), fire (hot listing — use sparingly)

### 4. Hashtag Strategy (15-20 Mix)

Build your hashtag set from three tiers:

**Broad (5-7):** High-volume, category-level
- `#realestate` `#homeforsale` `#dreamhome` `#newhome` `#househunting` `#justlisted` `#openhouse`

**Local (5-7):** City, neighborhood, region-specific
- `#[city]realestate` `#[city]homes` `#[neighborhood]living` `#[state]realestate` `#livein[city]` `#[city]realtor`

**Niche (3-5):** Property-type or buyer-specific
- `#firsttimehomebuyer` `#luxuryliving` `#investmentproperty` `#modernfarmhouse` `#midcenturymodern` `#mountainhome`

**Hashtag placement:** Either at the bottom of the caption separated by five line breaks, or in the first comment. Both work — consistency matters more than placement.

### 5. CTA Before the "More" Fold

When possible, embed a micro-CTA within the first 125 characters, or place your primary CTA early enough that readers see it without extensive scrolling.

**Good CTA placements:**
- In the hook: "Just listed — DM for a private showing."
- Immediately after features: "Link in bio for the full tour."
- As the final line before hashtags: "Save this post and share with someone house-hunting."

## Three Tones for Instagram

### Professional Tone

Authoritative but approachable. You're the trusted advisor.

```
Just listed in Downtown Bozeman — 3 bed, 2.5 bath craftsman
with original hardwood floors and a chef's kitchen renovation.

This 1,920 sq ft home sits on a tree-lined street two blocks
from Main Street. Updated systems, new roof (2024), and a
fenced backyard with mature landscaping.

Offered at $525,000

Schedule your showing — link in bio or DM for details.
```

### Casual Tone

Warm, conversational, relatable. You're a friend who found something great.

```
Okay but this kitchen though. Seriously, wait till you
see the before and after on this Bozeman craftsman.

3 beds, 2.5 baths, and a backyard that actually feels
like a backyard. Two blocks from Main Street so you can
walk to everything. New roof, updated everything, and
still under $530K.

This one's going to go fast. DM me before it does.
```

### Luxury Tone

Elevated, sensory, exclusive. You're curating an experience.

```
A residence of quiet distinction in the heart of Bozeman.

Behind the craftsman facade lies a thoughtfully reimagined
interior — hand-selected hardwoods, a kitchen designed for
gathering, and light that shifts through every room as the
day unfolds.

Steps from Main Street. A lifetime from ordinary.

Private viewings available — inquire via DM.
```

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

### 1. The Wall of Text
Never write a single unbroken paragraph. Instagram users scan — give them structure, line breaks, and breathing room.

### 2. The Feature Dump
Listing every feature without context or benefit. "3 bed 2 bath 1920 sqft hardwood floors granite counters stainless appliances new roof fenced yard" reads like a database export, not an ad.

### 3. The Hashtag Overload
Using all 30 hashtags, especially irrelevant ones like `#love` `#instagood` `#photooftheday`. This signals spam to both the algorithm and potential buyers.

### 4. The Missing Hook
Starting with "Check out this beautiful home!" or "New listing alert!" — these are generic and earn zero attention. Every competitor uses them.

### 5. ALL CAPS Excitement
"JUST LISTED!!! AMAZING HOME!!!" reads as desperate, not exciting. Let the property speak for itself.

### 6. Link in Caption
Writing out a full URL in the caption. Links in Instagram captions are not clickable. Always direct to "link in bio" or "DM for details."

### 7. Ignoring the Visual
Writing copy that describes what's clearly visible in the photo. If the image shows a stunning kitchen, don't open with "This home has a beautiful kitchen." Add context the image can't convey: the neighborhood, the story, the feeling.

## Good vs Bad Examples

### Example 1: Starter Home

**Bad:**
```
New listing! Beautiful 3 bedroom 2 bathroom home in great
neighborhood! Updated kitchen and bathrooms! Great backyard
for entertaining! Won't last long! Call us today!
#realestate #home #beautiful #amazing #love #instagood
#photooftheday #homeforsale #dreamhome #newhome
```

*Problems: Generic hook, exclamation overload, no specific details, irrelevant hashtags, no price, no location, no CTA path.*

**Good:**
```
$349,900 in Midtown — and yes, that kitchen is brand new.

3 bed | 2 bath | 1,450 sq ft on a quiet cul-de-sac in the
Meadowlark neighborhood. Ten-minute walk to Lindley Park,
five minutes to downtown.

What's new: kitchen (2025), both bathrooms, HVAC, and
water heater. What's original: the hardwood floors and
the massive backyard maple that shades the whole patio.

Open house this Saturday, 11-1. Link in bio for details
or DM to schedule a private tour.
```

*Why it works: Price hook, specific location, feature-to-benefit writing, neighborhood context, clear CTA, reasonable length.*

### Example 2: Luxury Property

**Bad:**
```
STUNNING LUXURY HOME FOR SALE!!! This gorgeous property
features 5 bedrooms, 4 bathrooms, gourmet kitchen, home
theater, wine cellar, pool, and breathtaking views!!!
Must see to believe!!! DM for info!!!

#luxury #luxuryhome #mansion #rich #lifestyle #goals
#dreamhome #luxuryrealestate #milliondollarlisting
```

*Problems: ALL CAPS, excessive exclamation marks, feature dump without story, no location, no price context, aspirational hashtags that attract browsers not buyers.*

**Good:**
```
Where the Gallatin Valley meets the mountains — and every
window frames the proof.

This 5-bedroom estate on 2.5 acres was designed around one
idea: bring the outside in. Floor-to-ceiling glass in the
great room. A chef's kitchen that opens to a covered terrace.
A wine room carved from reclaimed barn timber.

Below the main level: a private theater and a heated pool
with a vanishing edge that mirrors the ridgeline beyond.

Offered at $2.85M | Private tours by appointment

Details at link in bio. For a confidential conversation,
DM or call directly.
```

*Why it works: Evocative opening, sensory details, unique features highlighted with context, price stated, appropriate exclusivity in CTA.*

### Example 3: Investment Property

**Bad:**
```
Great investment opportunity! Duplex for sale! Both units
rented! Cash flowing property! Great returns! Don't miss
out on this deal! Message me for details!

#investing #realestateinvesting #passiveincome #cashflow
#wealthbuilding #financialfreedom
```

*Problems: Every sentence is a claim with no evidence. No numbers, no location, no actual investment details. This could describe any property anywhere.*

**Good:**
```
$2,400/mo gross rent. $289K ask. Do the math.

Side-by-side duplex in Bozeman's university corridor —
both units occupied with long-term tenants. Unit A: 2 bed/1
bath, $1,200/mo. Unit B: 2 bed/1 bath, $1,200/mo. Both
leases run through May 2027.

New roof (2024), separate utilities, off-street parking
for 4. Vacancy rate in this area: under 2%.

Investor packet with full financials available —
DM or link in bio.
```

*Why it works: Opens with the numbers investors care about, specific rental data, location with market context, capex details, professional CTA with investor-specific resource.*

## Caption Length Guidelines

| Post Type | Recommended Length | Why |
|-----------|-------------------|-----|
| Just Listed | 150-300 words | Enough for hook + key details + CTA |
| Open House | 80-150 words | Event-focused, time-sensitive |
| Sold/Closed | 50-100 words | Celebratory, brief |
| Market Update | 100-200 words | Data-driven, educational |
| Neighborhood Spotlight | 200-350 words | Storytelling opportunity |
| Price Reduction | 80-150 words | Urgency without desperation |

---

## Instagram Stories & Reels Copy

### Stories
- Keep text overlays under 100 characters
- One idea per story slide
- Use polls and question stickers for engagement
- "Swipe up" or "Link" sticker replaces "link in bio" for eligible accounts
- Front-load the property's single best feature

### Reels
- Caption matters less — the video does the work
- Hook in first 3 seconds (text overlay + spoken)
- Caption should add context the video doesn't cover
- Trending audio can boost reach but choose appropriately — skip comedic audio for luxury listings

---
