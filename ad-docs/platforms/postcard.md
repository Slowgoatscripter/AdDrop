# Postcard (Direct Mail) Real Estate Ad Copy Guide

## Platform Overview

Postcards are the original real estate marketing tool — and still one of the most effective. Unlike digital ads, a postcard occupies physical space. It gets held, flipped, placed on a counter, stuck on a fridge. The average person spends 3-5 seconds deciding whether to read or trash a piece of mail. Your copy has to earn those seconds with immediate impact.

Print copy follows different rules than digital. There are no clicks, no "see more," no links. The entire message must land on a single physical card, and the call to action must be memorable enough that someone acts on it later — possibly hours or days later.

## Format Constraints

### Front of Postcard

| Element | Guideline | Notes |
|---------|-----------|-------|
| Headline | ~60 characters max | Must be readable from arm's length |
| Body text | ~200 characters max | Supporting the headline, not replacing it |
| Image | Dominant (60-70% of front) | The image is the hook on a postcard |
| Font size | Headline: 24-36pt, Body: 14-18pt | Must be legible without reading glasses |
| Bleed | Full bleed preferred | Edge-to-edge images look professional |

### Back of Postcard

| Element | Guideline | Notes |
|---------|-----------|-------|
| Headline | ~40 characters | Reinforces or extends front message |
| Body text | 300-500 characters | Room for details, features, neighborhood |
| Contact info | Name, phone, email, website | Must be prominent — this is the CTA |
| Address area | Required for mailing | USPS regulations dictate placement |
| Logo/branding | Present but not dominant | Don't let branding eat your copy space |
| QR code | Optional but effective | Links to listing, virtual tour, or landing page |

### Standard Postcard Sizes

| Size | Dimensions | Best For |
|------|-----------|----------|
| Standard | 4" x 6" | Just listed/sold, market updates |
| Jumbo | 5.5" x 8.5" | Featured listings, neighborhood reports |
| Oversized | 6" x 11" | Luxury listings, multi-property mailers |

## Best Practices

### 1. Immediate Impact Design Principle

A postcard is not a brochure. You have one chance, one glance. The front must communicate the core message in under 3 seconds.

**The 3-second test:** Hold your postcard at arm's length. Can you understand the message? If you have to squint, read small text, or decode the layout, redesign.

**Front copy hierarchy:**
1. **Headline** — The one thing you want them to know (biggest text)
2. **Subhead or body** — Supporting context (second biggest)
3. **Image** — Emotional proof of the headline's promise
4. **Logo/contact** — Who sent this (smallest, corner placement)

### 2. Headline Writing for Print

Print headlines follow different rules than digital. They must:
- Be readable at a distance (no long sentences)
- Work without context (no "click to learn more")
- Create enough interest to flip the card
- Feel like news, not advertising

**Effective print headlines:**

```
Just Listed on Birch Street — $485,000
```
(47 chars — specific, newsworthy, price anchored)

```
Your Neighbor's Home Just Sold for $520K
```
(41 chars — personal relevance, social proof, price curiosity)

```
3 Homes Sold in Meadowlark This Month
```
(38 chars — market activity, neighborhood specific)

```
Thinking About Selling? Here's What Your Home Is Worth
```
(55 chars — direct address, value offer)

```
New to Market: The View From This Deck
```
(38 chars — curiosity, pairs with image)

**Weak print headlines:**

```
Looking for Your Dream Home? (too generic)
Your Trusted Real Estate Professional (self-focused)
Real Estate Market Update (boring, no hook)
Amazing Home for Sale!!! (empty superlative)
Contact Us Today! (not a headline — it's a CTA)
```

### 3. Neighborhood Hooks

Postcards are typically mailed to a specific geographic area. Use that. Reference the neighborhood by name. Mention local landmarks. Make the recipient feel like this was written for their street, not mass-produced.

**Neighborhood-specific angles:**

- **Just Listed/Sold**: "Another Meadowlark home just sold above asking. Here's what that means for your home's value."
- **Market update**: "5 homes sold in your neighborhood this quarter. Average price: $487,000."
- **Seasonal**: "Spring is the strongest selling season in Meadowlark. If you've been considering a move, the next 90 days matter."
- **New neighbor**: "Welcome to Meadowlark — here's a quick guide to the best of the neighborhood."
- **Community**: "The Lindley Park renovation is complete. Here's how it's already affecting home values nearby."

### 4. Clear CTA with Contact Info

Unlike digital ads, your CTA can't be a clickable button. The recipient must remember your contact information or take action later. Make the CTA and contact info impossible to miss.

**CTA principles for print:**
- Use a verb-first CTA: "Call for a free home valuation" not "Free home valuations available"
- Include phone number in large text (16pt+)
- Include website URL that's short and memorable
- QR codes bridge print to digital — use them for virtual tours or instant scheduling
- Place contact info on both front and back when possible

**Effective print CTAs:**

### 5. Front-Back Flow

The front and back of a postcard should work together as a narrative, not repeat each other.

**Pattern 1: Hook → Details**
- Front: Big image + "Just Listed: $485,000" headline
- Back: Property details, features, open house info, contact

**Pattern 2: Question → Answer**
- Front: "What's your Meadowlark home worth today?" + image of neighborhood
- Back: Recent comps, market context, CTA for free valuation

**Pattern 3: News → Action**
- Front: "3 Homes Sold on Your Street This Year" + sold prices
- Back: What this means for homeowners, how to get your home's value, contact

**Pattern 4: Image → Story**
- Front: Stunning property photo + minimal text (address + price)
- Back: The story of the home — lifestyle, neighborhood, unique features, showing info

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

### 1. Too Much Text on the Front
The front of a postcard is a billboard, not a brochure page. If your front has more than 2 lines of text (headline + subhead), you have too much. Let the image and headline do the work.

### 2. Tiny Font
If any text is below 12pt on the back or below 18pt on the front, it won't be read. People check mail standing up, often in poor lighting. Legibility trumps completeness.

### 3. Missing Contact Information
Burying the phone number in small text at the bottom, or worse, omitting it entirely and relying on a website URL. Many postcard recipients will call. Make the number prominent.

### 4. Generic Stock Photos
Using a stock photo of a model family in front of a generic house. Use actual property photos, actual neighborhood shots, or actual headshots. Authenticity matters more in print than anywhere else.

### 5. No Reason to Keep It
If the postcard offers no ongoing value (market data, neighborhood info, a future event date), it goes straight to recycling. Give recipients a reason to stick it on the fridge or save it for later.

### 6. Digital Language in Print
"Click here," "Swipe up," "Link in bio," "DM me" — none of these work on a physical card. Use print-appropriate CTAs: "Call," "Scan this QR code," "Visit," "Text HOME to..."

### 7. Cluttered Design
Trying to fit every feature, a map, three photos, a logo, a headshot, testimonials, and contact info on one side. White space is your friend. A clean, focused postcard outperforms a busy one every time.

## Good vs Bad Examples

### Example 1: Just Listed

**Bad Front:**
```
NEW LISTING!!! MUST SEE!!!
742 Birch Street, Bozeman
3 Bed, 2 Bath, 1,680 Sq Ft
Updated Kitchen, New HVAC
Mountain Views, Fenced Yard
Walk to Lindley Park!
$485,000
Call (406) 555-0123 TODAY!!!
[Small property photo squeezed into remaining space]
```

*Problems: Text-heavy front, no visual impact, exclamation marks everywhere, all information crammed onto one side, the photo is an afterthought.*

**Good Front:**
```
[Full-bleed hero image of the kitchen or mountain view from deck]

Just Listed | $485,000
742 Birch Street, Meadowlark
```

*Why it works: Image dominates, headline delivers the news, price creates context, address and neighborhood for local recognition. Flip for details.*

### Example 2: Market Update

**Bad Back:**
```
ATTENTION HOMEOWNERS! The market is HOT HOT HOT!
Homes are selling FAST and for TOP DOLLAR! If you
have been thinking about selling your home, NOW is
the time! Don't wait! The spring market is almost
here and you don't want to miss out on this
incredible opportunity! Call me TODAY for a FREE
home evaluation! I am a top producing agent with
years of experience and I would love to help you

```

*Problems: All hype, no data, no specifics, self-promotional, exclamation overload, no reason to believe any claim.*

**Good Back:**
```
Meadowlark by the Numbers — Last 90 Days

Homes Sold: 8
Median Price: $478,000 (up 6% year-over-year)
Avg Days to Sell: 12
Price Per Sq Ft: $284

last checked. I can run your address through the
same data I use for my sellers — takes 5 minutes,
no obligation.

- Full color front, always
- Back can be full color or two-color (depends on budget and volume)
- Ensure text has sufficient contrast against background (dark text on light, or reversed out of dark with enough weight)

- Targeted lists for specific demographics or past clients
- First-class postage for time-sensitive content (open house, just listed)
