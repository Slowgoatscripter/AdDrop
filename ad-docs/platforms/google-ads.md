# Google Ads Real Estate Copy Guide

## Platform Overview

Google Ads is the most constrained platform you'll write for — and the most intentional. Every person who sees your ad has actively searched for something related to your listing. They have intent. Your job is not to create desire (like social media) but to match their intent with the right message in brutally limited space.

Every character counts. There is no room for filler, cleverness for its own sake, or vague language. Google Ads copy is about precision, relevance, and action.

## Format Constraints

### Responsive Search Ads (RSA)

| Element | Limit | Notes |
|---------|-------|-------|
| Headlines | Up to 15 headlines, 30 characters each | Google shows 2-3 at a time |
| Descriptions | Up to 4 descriptions, 90 characters each | Google shows 1-2 at a time |
| Display URL path | Two fields, 15 characters each | Customizable (e.g., /Bozeman/Homes) |
| Final URL | Full URL to landing page | Must match ad content |

### Key Constraints

- **30 characters per headline**: This is approximately 4-6 words. Every word must earn its place.
- **90 characters per description**: About 12-15 words. One clear thought per description.
- **Headlines appear in any combination**: Write headlines that make sense in any order. Don't write headlines that depend on being read together.
- **Keyword insertion**: Use {KeyWord:Default Text} to dynamically insert the user's search term.
- **No guaranteed order**: Google's algorithm chooses which headlines and descriptions to show. Write each one to stand alone.

---

## Best Practices

### 1. Every Character Counts

At 30 characters, you cannot afford a single wasted word. Strip every headline to its essence.

**Character-efficient techniques:**
- Use numerals, not words: "3 Bed" not "Three Bedroom" (saves 9 chars)
- Abbreviate where clear: "sq ft" not "square feet", "BA" or "Bath" not "Bathroom"
- Use "|" or "-" as separators: "Bozeman | 3 Bed | $425K"
- Drop articles: "View the Home" becomes "View Home Now"
- Use symbols: "$" not "dollars", "&" not "and" (saves 2 chars)

### 2. Benefit-Driven, Not Feature-Driven

Search users want solutions. Lead with what they get, not what the property has.

| Feature-Driven (Weaker) | Benefit-Driven (Stronger) |
|--------------------------|---------------------------|
| "3 Bedroom Home For Sale" | "Space for Your Family" |
| "Updated Kitchen" | "Move-In Ready Bozeman Home" |
| "Large Backyard" | "Entertain Outdoors Year-Round" |
| "New Construction" | "Brand New, Never Lived In" |
| "Low HOA Fees" | "Own for Less Than Rent" |

### 3. Action Verbs First

Start headlines and descriptions with verbs when possible. Action verbs create momentum and imply the reader should do something.

**Strong action verbs for real estate ads:**
- Tour, View, Explore, Discover, See
- Schedule, Book, Request, Get, Claim
- Find, Search, Browse, Compare
- Save, Invest, Own, Build
- Move, Live, Settle, Call Home

**Examples:**
- "Tour This Bozeman Home Today"
- "Schedule Your Private Showing"
- "Explore Homes Under $400K"
- "Find Your Next Investment"

### 4. Include Price and Location When Space Permits

Users searching for real estate almost always have a price range and location in mind. Including these signals relevance immediately.

**Headlines with price:**
- "Bozeman Homes From $350K" (25 chars)
- "Homes Under $500K Bozeman" (25 chars)
- "$425K | 3 Bed | Downtown" (25 chars)

**Headlines with location:**
- "Homes for Sale in Bozeman" (25 chars)
- "Bozeman MT Real Estate" (22 chars)
- "Downtown Bozeman Homes" (22 chars)
- "Meadowlark Neighborhood" (23 chars)

### 5. Write Multiple Variations

Google RSAs test combinations automatically. Give the algorithm good options by writing diverse headlines that cover different angles.

**Headline angle categories:**
1. **Location**: "Homes in Bozeman MT"
2. **Price**: "Starting at $350,000"
3. **Property type**: "3 Bed Ranch for Sale"
4. **Benefit**: "Move-In Ready Today"
5. **Urgency**: "Just Listed This Week"
6. **CTA**: "Schedule a Tour Now"
7. **Trust**: "Top-Rated Bozeman Agent"
8. **Unique feature**: "Mountain View Home"

Provide at least 8-10 headlines covering 4+ angles.

### 6. Keyword Relevance

Your ad must match the user's search intent. If someone searches "3 bedroom homes Bozeman under 400K," your ad needs to signal that you have exactly that.

**Keyword matching strategies:**
- Mirror the search language in at least one headline
- Use keyword insertion: `{KeyWord:Bozeman Homes for Sale}`
- Include location in both headlines and descriptions
- Match the specificity of the search (don't show a generic "homes for sale" ad to someone searching for "3 bed ranch Bozeman Meadowlark")

## Headline Writing Workshop

### The 30-Character Challenge

Here are common real estate headline needs, written to fit within 30 characters:

| Intent | Headline | Chars |
|--------|----------|-------|
| General listing | Bozeman Homes for Sale | 22 |
| Price point | Homes Under $400K Bozeman | 25 |
| Specific property | 3 Bed Ranch in Meadowlark | 25 |
| New listing | Just Listed in Bozeman | 22 |
| Open house | Open House This Saturday | 24 |
| CTA | Schedule Your Tour Today | 23 |
| Benefit | Move-In Ready Bozeman Home | 26 |
| Urgency | Won't Last - View Today | 23 |
| Trust | 5-Star Rated Local Agent | 24 |
| Investment | Bozeman Investment Property | 27 |
| Luxury | Luxury Bozeman Estate | 21 |
| First-time | First Home? Start Here | 22 |
| Value | Best Value in Bozeman | 21 |
| Feature | Mountain Views & 3 Acres | 24 |
| Location | Walk to Downtown Bozeman | 24 |

### Headlines That DON'T Work

| Bad Headline | Problem | Chars |
|-------------|---------|-------|
| "Beautiful Home For Sale Now" | Generic, no location or price | 28 |
| "Click Here To See This Amazing Listing" | Too long, no specifics | 39 (over!) |
| "We Have the Best Homes!!!" | Empty claim, wasted punctuation | 26 |
| "Real Estate" | Too vague, no value prop | 11 |
| "Don't Miss Out On This" | No information, just pressure | 22 |
| "Check This Out" | Zero relevance signal | 14 |

## Description Writing Workshop

### The 90-Character Challenge

Descriptions carry the detail that headlines can't fit. Use them for:
- Expanding on the headline's promise
- Adding a secondary benefit
- Including a clear CTA
- Providing social proof or urgency

**Good descriptions (under 90 characters):**

```
Tour 3-bed, 2-bath homes in Bozeman from $350K. Schedule your showing online today. (84)
```

```
Move-in ready homes in Bozeman's top neighborhoods. View listings and book a tour now. (87)
```

```
Explore new listings in Bozeman updated daily. Find your dream home - search starts here. (89)
```

```
5-star rated Bozeman real estate team. 200+ families helped find their perfect home. (83)
```

```
Bozeman homes selling fast - avg 12 days on market. Don't wait. Schedule your tour today. (89)
```

**Bad descriptions:**

```
We are the best real estate company in Bozeman and we have amazing homes for sale now!! (88)
```
*Problem: Empty superlatives, no specific value, wasted exclamation marks.*

```
Click here to see our listings. We have many homes available in the area. Contact us. (86)
```
*Problem: "Click here" wastes space, "many homes" and "the area" are vague.*

```
Beautiful stunning gorgeous homes with amazing views and incredible features for sale. (86)
```
*Problem: Adjective pile-up with zero specifics. Every word is filler.*

## Ad Group Structure for Real Estate

Organize your campaigns by search intent for maximum relevance:

### By Property Type
- "Bozeman single family homes"
- "Bozeman condos for sale"
- "Bozeman townhouses"
- "Bozeman land for sale"

### By Buyer Intent
- "Homes for sale Bozeman" (browsing)
- "Buy a home in Bozeman" (ready to act)
- "Bozeman open houses this weekend" (high intent)
- "Bozeman real estate agent" (seeking help)

### By Price Range
- "Bozeman homes under 400K"
- "Bozeman homes 400K to 600K"
- "Luxury homes Bozeman"

### By Neighborhood
- "Meadowlark Bozeman homes"
- "Downtown Bozeman real estate"
- "Bozeman south side homes"

---

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

### 1. Wasting Characters on Filler
Words like "very," "really," "amazing," "beautiful," "great" consume characters without adding relevance. Replace them with specifics.

### 2. Writing Headlines That Need Each Other
Since Google shows headlines in random combinations, never write headlines like "The Perfect Home" + "Is Waiting for You." They must make sense independently.

### 3. Ignoring Search Intent
If your ad group targets "investment property Bozeman," don't show headlines about "dream home" or "family-friendly." Match the language to the searcher's intent.

### 4. All Headlines in the Same Angle
If all 10 headlines are variations of "Bozeman Homes for Sale," you're missing opportunities. Diversify across location, price, benefits, CTA, and trust signals.

### 5. Missing CTA
Every ad should include at least one CTA headline and one CTA description. Without a clear action step, even a well-written ad loses conversions.

### 6. Excessive Punctuation
"Best Homes!!! Amazing Views!!!" — Google may disapprove the ad, and even if it runs, it signals low quality. One exclamation mark per ad maximum, and only in descriptions.

### 7. Inconsistent Landing Pages
The ad promises "3 Bed Homes Under $400K" but the landing page shows all listings. The disconnect kills conversion rates. Match ad copy to landing page content exactly.

## Good vs Bad Ad Examples

### Example 1: General Listing Campaign

**Bad Ad:**
```
Headlines:
- Beautiful Homes For Sale
- Best Real Estate Company
- Click Here Now
- Amazing Properties Available
- Don't Miss These Homes

Descriptions:
- We have the best homes in the area. Contact us today for more info about listings!!
- Beautiful amazing stunning homes for sale. We are the top real estate team. Call now!
```

*Problems: No location, no price, no specifics, no benefit, wasted superlatives, double exclamation marks, headlines that could be for any business in any city.*

**Good Ad:**
```
Headlines:
- Bozeman Homes for Sale (22)
- 3 Bed Homes From $350K (22)
- Tour Bozeman Homes Today (24)
- New Listings Updated Daily (25)
- Meadowlark & Downtown (21)
- Schedule a Private Showing (26)
- Move-In Ready Bozeman (21)
- Top-Rated Bozeman Agent (22)
- Open Houses This Weekend (24)
- Find Your Bozeman Home (22)

Descriptions:
- Browse 50+ active Bozeman listings by price, neighborhood & features. Updated daily. (85)
- Schedule a private showing today. Avg response time under 30 min. Local expertise. (83)
- Bozeman homes selling in 14 days avg. See new listings before they hit the market. (82)
- First-time buyer? Get pre-qualified help & neighborhood guides. Start your search now. (87)
```

*Why it works: Location in most headlines, price specifics, multiple angles (CTA, urgency, trust, benefit), descriptions add real value and data.*

### Example 2: Specific Listing

**Bad Ad:**
```
Headlines:
- House For Sale
- 3 Bed 2 Bath
- Great Location

Descriptions:
- This home is in a great neighborhood with many features. Come see it today!
```

**Good Ad:**
```
Headlines:
- 742 Birch St Bozeman $485K (26)
- 3 Bed Ranch | Meadowlark (25)
- Updated Kitchen & New Roof (26)
- Tour 742 Birch This Week (24)
- Walk to Lindley Park (20)
- Open House Saturday 10 AM (26)

Descriptions:
- 1,680 sq ft ranch in Meadowlark. New kitchen, new HVAC, fenced yard. Open Sat 10-12. (87)
- Walk to Lindley Park & downtown. Updated 3-bed ranch at $485K. Schedule your tour now. (87)
```

*Why it works: Specific address for branded searches, price, neighborhood, key features, event-based urgency, walkability benefit.*

### Example 3: Investor-Focused

**Bad Ad:**
```
Headlines:
- Investment Property
- Make Money In Real Estate
- Great Returns Available

Descriptions:
- Invest in real estate today! Great cash flow properties available. Call for details.
```

**Good Ad:**
```
Headlines:
- Bozeman Duplex | $2,400/mo (27)
- 8.2% Cap Rate | Bozeman (24)
- Cash Flow Rental Property (24)
- Both Units Occupied (19)
- Investment Property $289K (25)
- Get the Investor Packet (24)

Descriptions:
- Side-by-side duplex, both units leased through 2027. $2,400/mo gross. New roof 2024. (87)
- Full financials & comps available. Bozeman rental vacancy under 2%. Request packet now. (88)
```

*Why it works: Leads with numbers investors care about, specific cap rate, occupancy status, concrete financials, professional CTA.*
