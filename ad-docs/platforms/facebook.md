# Facebook Real Estate Ad Copy Guide

## Platform Overview

Facebook remains the dominant platform for real estate marketing because it supports longer-form content, community-oriented messaging, and targeted distribution. Unlike Instagram's visual-first approach, Facebook rewards storytelling, engagement, and shareable content. The audience skews toward homeowners and serious buyers who are willing to read — if you give them a reason to.

## Format Constraints

| Element | Limit | Notes |
|---------|-------|-------|
| Post text | 63,206 characters max | But effective posts are 100-400 words |
| Preview truncation | ~125 characters | Before "See more" on feed |
| Ad primary text | 125 characters visible | Rest hidden behind "See more" |
| Ad headline | 40 characters | Below the image in ad format |
| Ad description | 30 characters | Below headline in ad format |
| Link preview title | ~70 characters | Auto-pulled or customizable |
| Comments | Unlimited | Engagement in comments boosts reach |
| Shared post text | Separate from original | Add your own commentary when sharing |

### The 125-Character Preview

Just like Instagram, Facebook truncates feed posts at roughly 125 characters. But Facebook users are more conditioned to click "See more" — especially when the preview promises valuable, specific information. Your opening must create a clear information gap.

## Best Practices

### 1. Lead with Story, Not Stats

Facebook's algorithm rewards engagement — likes, comments, shares, and time spent reading. Storytelling drives all of these. Start with something human, then layer in the property details.

**Story-first approach:**
```
When we first walked into this house, the sellers told us
they'd raised three kids here. You can see it — the height
marks on the kitchen doorframe, the treehouse still standing
in the backyard, the wear on the stairs where a thousand
bedtimes happened.

Now it's ready for its next family.
```

**Stats-first approach (weaker on Facebook):**
```
4 bed, 3 bath, 2,400 sq ft. Built in 1998. Updated kitchen
and bathrooms. Large backyard. Two-car garage.
```

The story version gets shared. The stats version gets scrolled past.

### 2. Community and Lifestyle Angle

Facebook users connect through community. Tie the property to its neighborhood, local landmarks, schools, and lifestyle.

**Effective community hooks:**
- "Three blocks from [popular local spot]"
- "In the [school name] district — rated 9/10"
- "The neighbors actually know each other here"
- "Saturday mornings: walk to the farmers market, coffee at [local shop], home by noon"
- "This street hosts a block party every Fourth of July"

### 3. Engagement Optimization

Write posts that invite interaction. Facebook's algorithm amplifies posts with comments.

**Engagement-driving techniques:**
- Ask a question: "What's the first thing you'd do with this backyard?"
- Create a poll (native feature): "This kitchen: modern update or keep the vintage charm?"
- Invite opinions: "Hot take: this might be the best street in [neighborhood]. Change my mind."
- Tag relevant context: "Know someone looking in [area]? Tag them below."
- Respond to every comment to double the comment count and show algorithm activity

### 4. Local Market Knowledge Showcase

Position yourself as the neighborhood expert. Facebook audiences trust agents who clearly know the area.

**Market knowledge signals:**
- Reference recent comparable sales with context
- Mention neighborhood-specific trends
- Name local businesses, parks, and schools by name
- Share insights only a local would know ("This street floods during spring runoff" — honesty builds trust)
- Comment on what makes this listing different from others in the area

### 5. Shareable Content Design

The most valuable Facebook content gets shared to friends and family. Design posts that people want to forward.

**Shareable triggers:**
- "Know someone looking for..." opener
- Beautiful primary photo that stands alone without context
- Price points that surprise ("Under $300K in [expensive area]? Yes, really.")
- Unique features worth talking about ("This home has a secret room behind the bookcase.")
- Helpful information beyond the listing (neighborhood guides, market reports)

## Three Tones for Facebook

### Professional Tone

Authoritative, informative, community-aware. You're the market expert.

```
Just Listed | 742 Birch Street, Bozeman | $485,000

This 3-bedroom, 2-bath ranch in the Meadowlark neighborhood
checks every box for buyers looking for single-level living
close to town.

The home was built in 2005 and has been meticulously maintained
by the original owners. Recent updates include a full kitchen
renovation (2024), new HVAC system, and a professionally
landscaped backyard with automated irrigation.

At 1,680 square feet on a 0.18-acre lot, it offers comfortable
living without excessive maintenance. The attached two-car
garage includes built-in storage and a dedicated EV charging
outlet.

Meadowlark is one of Bozeman's most walkable neighborhoods —
Lindley Park is a five-minute walk, and the co-op is even
closer. Homes in this area have appreciated 12% over the past
18 months, and inventory remains tight.

Open house this Saturday 10 AM - 12 PM, or schedule a private
showing at the link below.

Full details and photos: [link]
```

### Casual Tone

Warm, conversational, enthusiastic without being salesy. You're a neighbor sharing good news.

```
Okay, I have to tell you about this one.

742 Birch Street just came on the market and I genuinely
think it's one of the best values in Bozeman right now.
$485K for a fully updated 3-bed ranch in Meadowlark?
With THAT kitchen? Come on.

The owners have babied this house for 20 years and it shows.
New kitchen, new HVAC, and a backyard that looks like it
belongs in a magazine (they even put in automatic sprinklers
so you don't have to think about it).

Walk to Lindley Park. Walk to the co-op. Walk to basically
everything you need.

I'm doing an open house Saturday 10-12 if you want to see
it in person. Or DM me and I'll get you in before then.

Fair warning: I don't think this one sits long.

```

### Luxury Tone

Refined, narrative-driven, exclusive. You're presenting an opportunity to a discerning audience.

```
742 Birch Street, Bozeman — a study in thoughtful living.

For two decades, the original owners of this Meadowlark
residence have refined every detail. The result is a home
that feels both elevated and effortless.

The kitchen — recently reimagined with custom cabinetry,
quartzite surfaces, and integrated appliances — anchors an
open floor plan designed for hosting. Beyond the glass
sliders, the rear garden unfolds in layers: flagstone patio,
perennial borders, and a canopy of mature trees that filters
the afternoon light.

At 1,680 square feet, the proportions are intentional —
generous without excess, every room purposeful.

Meadowlark remains one of Bozeman's most coveted addresses.
This is a rare opportunity to enter the neighborhood at
$485,000.

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

### 1. The Broadcast Blast
Posting the same listing text across all platforms without adapting for Facebook's strengths. Facebook rewards engagement and community context — a copy-paste from MLS won't perform.

### 2. The Hard Sell
"DON'T MISS THIS INCREDIBLE DEAL!!! CALL NOW BEFORE IT'S GONE!!!" — Facebook users are in browse mode, not buy mode. Aggressive sales language gets hidden or unfollowed.

### 3. The Link-Only Post
Posting just a link with no copy, or minimal copy like "New listing!" followed by a link. Facebook's algorithm deprioritizes posts that drive users off-platform. Add substantial text that makes the post valuable even without clicking.

### 4. Ignoring Comments
Not responding to questions in comments is a missed opportunity and a signal to the algorithm that the post isn't generating real engagement. Every comment you reply to counts as two comments.

### 5. Stock Photo Vibes
Using generic descriptions that could apply to any property. "Beautiful home in a great neighborhood with amazing features!" tells the reader nothing and builds zero trust.

### 6. Oversharing Details Upfront
Dumping every detail — lot size, tax assessment, HOA fees, room dimensions, appliance brands — in the first paragraph. Lead with what matters emotionally, then layer in details for those who want them.

### 7. Missing Location Context
Listing features without connecting them to the local area. "5 minutes from downtown" is fine but "5 minutes from Main Street — close enough to walk to Plonk for dinner" is Facebook-grade copy.

## Good vs Bad Examples

### Example 1: Family Home

**Bad:**
```
NEW LISTING! 4BR/3BA home for sale in Bozeman! Great
location, great schools, great neighborhood! Updated
throughout! Large yard! Must see! Call me for details or
click the link below!

[link]

#bozeman #realestate #homeforsale #justlisted #dreamhome
```

*Problems: No specifics, no story, generic superlatives, hashtag style doesn't suit Facebook, no engagement hook.*

**Good:**
```
If "walking distance to Hawthorne Elementary" is on your
must-have list, keep reading.

This 4-bedroom, 3-bath in the Westridge neighborhood just
came on the market at $529,000 — and the backyard alone is
worth the showing.

We're talking a 0.22-acre lot with a fenced yard, a flagstone
patio with a built-in fire pit, and a garden shed that the
current owners use as an art studio (it has electricity and
insulation — the possibilities here are real).

Inside: 2,200 sq ft of living space with an updated kitchen
(gas range, quartz counters, soft-close everything), a main-
level primary suite, and a finished basement with the 4th
bedroom and a rec room that's basically a second living room.

The Westridge neighborhood is one of those places where kids
still ride bikes to their friends' houses. The park is two
blocks away, and the trail system connects to the Gallagator
Linear Park.

I'm hosting an open house Sunday 1-3 PM. Come see it, bring
your kids, and let them test the backyard. That's the real
selling point.

Questions? Drop them in the comments — I know this
neighborhood inside and out.

[link to listing]
```

*Why it works: Specific school hook, detailed features with benefits, neighborhood story, engagement invitation, personality.*

### Example 2: Condo

**Bad:**
```
Beautiful 2BR condo for sale! $275,000. Open floor plan,
in-unit laundry, one parking spot. Close to everything!
Great for first-time buyers or investors! Schedule your
showing today!
```

*Problems: No context about what "close to everything" means, no community angle, no engagement hook, could be any condo anywhere.*

**Good:**
```
A question I get all the time: "Is it possible to buy in
downtown Bozeman under $300K?"

Yes. Here's how.

This 2-bed, 1-bath condo at The Bridger Building is listed
at $275,000. That gets you 950 square feet of open-concept
living, in-unit laundry, one dedicated parking spot, and a
storage unit in the basement.

The building is well-managed — HOA is $285/month and covers
water, sewer, trash, snow removal, building insurance, and
a reserve fund that's fully funded (ask me why that matters
if you're not sure).

Location context: you're two blocks from the library, four
blocks from Main Street, and directly on the Streamline bus
route. If you work downtown, you might not need your car
Monday through Friday.

For first-time buyers: this is a genuine entry point into the
Bozeman market. For investors: comparable units in this
building rent for $1,600-$1,750/month.

Either way, it's worth a look. Open house Thursday 5-7 PM
(after-work friendly), or DM me to schedule something private.

Current homeowners — if you know someone trying to break into
the Bozeman market, share this post. It might be exactly what
they need.

[link]
```

*Why it works: Opens with a common question (engagement bait), addresses multiple audiences, provides context most agents skip (HOA details, comparable rents), invites sharing.*

### Example 3: Price Reduction

**Bad:**
```
PRICE REDUCED! Was $450K now $425K! Motivated seller!
Don't miss this opportunity! 3 bed 2 bath in Bozeman!
Call today!

[link]
```

*Problems: "Motivated seller" signals desperation, ALL CAPS, no property details, no reason to care.*

**Good:**
```
Price adjustment on 1847 Cottonwood Lane — now $425,000
(reduced from $450,000).

I want to be transparent about why: the sellers originally
priced based on spring comps, but the fall market has shifted
slightly. This new price puts the home right in line with
recent sales in the Oak Street corridor and, frankly, makes
it one of the better values in the neighborhood right now.

Quick refresher on the property: 3 bed, 2 bath, 1,580 sq ft
ranch with a fully fenced yard and a detached two-car garage
with workshop space. Kitchen was updated in 2023. Roof is
5 years old. The basement is unfinished but has rough-in
plumbing for a bathroom — future equity waiting to happen.

If you toured it before and the price was the sticking point,
this is worth a second look. If you're new to the search,
even better — you're seeing it at the right number.

DM me or comment below with questions. I have full comps
for the area if you want to see the data behind the pricing.

[link]
```

*Why it works: Transparent about the reduction (builds trust), provides market context, re-sells the property, invites engagement, positions the agent as data-driven.*

## Facebook-Specific Content Types

### Listing Posts
- Lead with story or community angle
- 200-400 words optimal
- Include high-quality photo (Facebook compresses heavily — use 1200x630 minimum)
- Always include a link
- End with engagement question or share request

### Market Update Posts
- Data + interpretation (don't just share numbers — explain what they mean)
- Use simple charts or infographics as images
- "What this means for you" framing
- Invite questions from buyers and sellers separately

### Just Sold Posts
- Celebrate the buyers (with permission), not yourself
- Share a lesson or insight from the transaction
- "If you're looking in [area], here's what the market is doing"
- Avoid humble-bragging ("Another one closed!" repeated weekly)

### Neighborhood Spotlight Posts
- Long-form works well (400-600 words)
- Include local business names, parks, and landmarks
- Share genuine insider knowledge
- Tag local businesses for cross-promotion and reach

### Video Posts
- Native video outperforms YouTube links by 10x in reach
- Caption every video (85% of Facebook video is watched without sound)
- Property tour videos: 60-90 seconds optimal
- Open with the best room or feature, not the front door

---

## Facebook Groups Strategy

Many real estate conversations happen in local Facebook Groups. When posting in groups:

- Follow group rules strictly (many ban agent posts except on designated days)
- Add genuine value — don't just drop listings
- Answer questions from other members to build authority
- When sharing a listing, add group-specific context: "Since several people in this group have been asking about [neighborhood]..."
- Never post the same listing in more than 2-3 groups on the same day
