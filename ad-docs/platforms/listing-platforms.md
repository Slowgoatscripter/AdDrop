# Listing Platforms Real Estate Copy Guide

## Platform Overview

Listing platforms — Zillow, Realtor.com, Homes.com, Trulia, and MLS systems — are where serious buyers go to shop. Unlike social media, where you're competing for attention against entertainment, listing platform visitors have declared intent: they are actively looking for a home. Your copy doesn't need to create interest — it needs to inform, differentiate, and convert.

The writing style here differs fundamentally from marketing copy. Listing descriptions must be accurate, comprehensive, professional, and SEO-conscious. Exaggerated marketing language that works on Instagram will undermine credibility on Zillow. These platforms reward substance over sizzle.

## Best Practices

### 1. SEO Keywords for Listing Platforms

Listing platforms use search algorithms. Buyers search by location, property type, features, and lifestyle keywords. Include these naturally in your description.

**High-value keywords to include:**

Location terms:
- City name, neighborhood name, subdivision name
- Nearby landmarks, schools, parks
- Compass directions when relevant ("south-facing backyard")
- County name (for rural properties)

Property terms:
- Architectural style: ranch, craftsman, colonial, modern, mid-century, farmhouse
- Construction: new construction, custom-built, recently renovated
- Condition: move-in ready, updated, turnkey, well-maintained

Feature terms:
- Kitchen: updated kitchen, granite/quartzite counters, stainless steel appliances, island
- Primary suite: main-level primary, en-suite bath, walk-in closet
- Outdoor: fenced yard, covered patio, deck, mountain views, creek, mature trees
- Extras: home office, bonus room, mudroom, pantry, garage, workshop

Lifestyle terms:
- Walkable, close to downtown, quiet street, cul-de-sac, private
- Near trails, near schools, near shopping
- Low maintenance, single-level living, open floor plan

**Keyword placement priority:**
1. First sentence (search preview)
2. First paragraph (Zillow and Google prioritize early text)
3. Feature descriptions (natural keyword integration)
4. Closing paragraph (location reinforcement)

### 2. Feature-Rich Descriptions

Listing platform buyers want details. Unlike social media where you tell a story, here you provide a comprehensive tour in words. Cover every room and feature that matters.

**Description structure (recommended order):**

1. **Opening hook** (1-2 sentences): Location + standout feature + price context
2. **Property overview** (2-3 sentences): Style, size, lot, condition summary
3. **Main level tour** (3-5 sentences): Entry, living areas, kitchen, dining
4. **Bedrooms and bathrooms** (2-4 sentences): Primary suite, secondary bedrooms, bath details
5. **Additional spaces** (2-3 sentences): Basement, bonus room, office, garage
6. **Outdoor features** (2-3 sentences): Yard, patio, views, landscaping
7. **Location context** (2-3 sentences): Neighborhood, proximity, schools, amenities
8. **Updates and systems** (2-3 sentences): Recent improvements, age of systems
9. **Closing** (1-2 sentences): Showing info, invitation to visit

### 3. Professional Tone Throughout

Listing platforms demand professionalism. The audience includes buyers, buyer's agents, appraisers, and inspectors. Everyone reading your description is evaluating the property seriously.

**Professional tone markers:**
- Third person ("The home features...") or direct address ("You'll find...")
- Accurate measurements and specifications
- Honest representation without overstatement
- Complete sentences (not fragments or ALL CAPS highlights)
- No exclamation marks (one maximum, used sparingly)
- No emoji
- No slang or overly casual language

### 4. Avoid Marketing Speak for MLS

MLS remarks are read by other agents. They expect facts, not fluff. Agent remarks especially should be data-driven and straightforward.

**MLS public remarks — appropriate:**
```
Meticulously maintained 3-bedroom, 2-bath ranch in the
Meadowlark neighborhood. Updated kitchen (2024) with
quartzite counters, soft-close cabinetry, and stainless
steel appliances. New HVAC (2024), 5-year-old roof, and
automated irrigation. Main-level living with open floor
plan, hardwood floors throughout main areas. Fenced
backyard with mountain views, flagstone patio, and mature
landscaping. Two-car attached garage with EV charging
outlet. Walk to Lindley Park (0.3 mi) and downtown (0.6 mi).
Showings begin Saturday 3/15. Offers due Monday 3/17 at 5 PM.
```

**MLS public remarks — inappropriate:**
```
WOW! You have to see this AMAZING home! It is absolutely
GORGEOUS and has been BEAUTIFULLY updated! The kitchen is
to DIE FOR and the backyard is a true PARADISE! This is
THE ONE you've been waiting for! Don't miss out on this
INCREDIBLE opportunity! Your dream home is HERE!
```

**MLS agent remarks — appropriate:**
```
Pre-inspected, report available. Sellers are relocating,
motivated but realistic. Offer deadline Mon 3/17 5 PM.
Multiple offers expected. Proof of funds or pre-approval
required with all offers. Showing instructions: ShowingTime,
24-hr notice preferred. Pets in home — please close doors
behind you. Co-op commission: 2.5%.
```

### 5. Disclosure Requirements

Many MLS systems and listing platforms require or strongly encourage specific disclosures in listing descriptions.

**Common required disclosures:**
- Lead-based paint notice (pre-1978 homes)
- HOA existence and approximate dues
- Known material defects (as required by state law)
- Special assessments
- Flood zone status
- Historical district restrictions
- Rental restrictions (for condos)
- Pending assessments or litigation (for condos/HOAs)

**Placement:** Disclosures typically appear at the end of the description, separated from marketing copy. Some MLS systems have dedicated fields.

## Platform-Specific Strategies

### Zillow-Specific

Zillow is the most-visited listing platform. Its search algorithm prioritizes:
- Keyword relevance to search queries
- Photo quality and quantity (not copy-related, but affects listing performance)
- Description completeness
- Engagement metrics (saves, shares, inquiries)

**Zillow "What I Love" section:**
Sellers can contribute up to 5 "What I Love About My Home" entries. Coach sellers to write specific, personal, authentic entries — these humanize the listing.

Good "What I Love" entries:
```
"Morning coffee on the back deck with the Bridgers in front
of me — it never gets old, even after 8 years."

"The neighbors. We have a standing Friday pizza night that
rotates houses. This street is a real community."

"The mudroom saved our sanity. With three kids and a dog,
having that transition space between the garage and kitchen
means the house actually stays clean."
```

Bad "What I Love" entries:
```
"Great home in great neighborhood!" (generic)
"Everything!" (useless)
"The beautiful updated kitchen!" (sounds like agent, not seller)
```

### Realtor.com-Specific

Realtor.com syndicates from MLS but allows enhanced listings with:
- Additional photos beyond MLS limits
- Virtual tour links
- Video integration
- Agent branding options

Optimize copy for Realtor.com by front-loading the most important keywords and features in the first two sentences, as their search preview is slightly shorter than Zillow's.

### MLS-Specific Strategy

Remember that MLS descriptions serve two audiences:
1. **Public remarks** → Buyers and their agents via syndication
2. **Agent remarks** → Cooperating agents only

**Public remarks focus:** Property appeal, features, location, lifestyle
**Agent remarks focus:** Showing instructions, offer terms, commission, property quirks, pre-inspection availability

Never put showing instructions or offer terms in public remarks — they clutter the buyer-facing description.

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

### 1. The Superlative Spiral
"Stunning, breathtaking, magnificent, gorgeous, spectacular, exquisite..." When every adjective is at maximum, the reader trusts none of them. Use one or two and support them with specific details.

### 2. The Feature-Less Description
"Beautiful home in great neighborhood with lots of updates! Must see!" — This description could apply to any home. It provides zero information a buyer can use to decide whether to visit.

### 3. ALL CAPS for Emphasis
"BRAND NEW KITCHEN! MUST SEE! PRICE REDUCED!" — ALL CAPS reads as shouting in a professional context. Use normal capitalization. If a feature is important, describe it well.

### 4. Misleading or Exaggerated Claims
"Gourmet kitchen" for a basic builder-grade kitchen with a laminate countertop. "Estate" for a 1,500 sq ft home on 0.15 acres. "Panoramic views" for a partial view through trees. Buyers visit properties. If the description oversells, trust evaporates and so does the offer.

### 5. Ignoring Negative Factors
Pretending a busy road, small yard, or dated bathroom doesn't exist. Sophisticated buyers and agents read between the lines. Address potential concerns by reframing: "Located on a well-traveled corridor with excellent visibility and easy access" is honest about a busy road without calling it a drawback.

### 6. Copy-Paste Across Platforms
Using the same 200-character MLS description on Zillow (which allows 4,500 characters). Maximize each platform. MLS gets the compressed version. Zillow and Realtor.com get the expanded, keyword-rich version.

### 7. Missing Location Context
Describing the home in detail but never mentioning the neighborhood, nearby amenities, schools, or commute times. For most buyers, location is the top priority. If your description doesn't address it, you're leaving out the most important information.

### 8. First-Person Agent Voice
"I just love this home! I think you will too!" The listing description should be about the property, not the agent's feelings. Third person or direct address ("you'll find...") is appropriate.

## Good vs Bad Examples

### Example 1: Standard Single-Family Home

**Bad:**
```
Beautiful 3 bedroom 2 bathroom home for sale! Updated
kitchen and bathrooms. Nice backyard. Close to everything.
Great neighborhood. Won't last long. Must see!
```
(52 words, 280 characters — leaves 4,200 characters unused on Zillow)

*Problems: No specifics, no location, no square footage, no updates detail, no room descriptions, no neighborhood name, wastes the available space.*

**Good:**
```
Move-in ready 3-bedroom, 2-bathroom ranch in Bozeman's
Meadowlark neighborhood — one of the most walkable areas
in town, just minutes from Lindley Park and downtown Main Street.

This 1,680 sq ft home was built in 2005 and has been
thoughtfully updated by the original owners. The kitchen
was fully renovated in 2024 with quartzite countertops,
soft-close maple cabinetry, a tile backsplash, and
stainless steel appliances including a gas range. The
open layout connects the kitchen to the dining area and
living room, where hardwood floors run throughout.

The primary bedroom is located at the back of the home
for privacy and includes a walk-in closet and an en-suite
bathroom with a tiled shower. Two additional bedrooms
share the updated hall bathroom, which features a
double vanity.

The main level is complemented by a dedicated laundry
room with storage, a coat closet at the entry, and a
small office nook in the hallway.

Step outside to a fully fenced backyard with mature
landscaping, automated irrigation, and a flagstone
patio with mountain views to the south. The backyard
is private — bordered by established trees on three sides.

The attached two-car garage includes built-in shelving,
a workbench, and an EV charging outlet. Additional
storage is available in the partial basement, which is
dry and accessible from inside the home.

Recent updates: kitchen renovation (2024), HVAC system
(2024), exterior paint (2023), water heater (2022).
The roof was replaced in 2021 with a 30-year architectural
shingle.

Meadowlark is a quiet, established neighborhood with
sidewalks, mature trees, and a strong sense of community.
Lindley Park is a 5-minute walk. The Bozeman Co-op is
3 minutes. Downtown Main Street is 10 minutes on foot or
3 minutes by car. Hawthorne Elementary is 0.8 miles.

Offered at $485,000. Showings begin Saturday, March 15.
Open house Saturday 10 AM - 12 PM.
```

*Why it works: Comprehensive room-by-room tour, specific update details with years, neighborhood context with distances, accurate feature descriptions, keyword-rich for search, professional tone throughout.*

### Example 2: Condo/Apartment

**Bad:**
```
Nice condo in downtown Bozeman. 2 bed 1 bath. In-unit
laundry. Parking included. Low HOA. Close to everything.
Great investment or starter home!
```

**Good:**
```
Downtown Bozeman condo in The Bridger Building — a well-
managed, well-located building two blocks from Main Street
in the heart of the downtown corridor.

Unit 204 is a 2-bedroom, 1-bathroom flat with 950 square
feet of open-concept living. The layout places the kitchen,
dining, and living areas along the south-facing windows,
providing natural light throughout the day. The kitchen
includes stainless steel appliances, laminate countertops,
a dishwasher, and a breakfast bar that seats three.

Both bedrooms are generously sized — the primary fits a
king bed and dresser comfortably, while the second bedroom
accommodates a queen bed or serves well as a home office.
The full bathroom has a tub/shower combo and updated
fixtures.

In-unit washer and dryer (front-load, included in sale).
Central heating and cooling. One dedicated parking spot
in the underground garage. One storage unit in the basement
(approximately 5' x 8').

Building amenities: secured entry, elevator, bike storage,
package room. The Bridger Building was constructed in 2012
and has a fully funded reserve per the most recent HOA study.

HOA: $285/month. Covers water, sewer, trash, snow removal,
building insurance, common area maintenance, and reserves.

Location context: 2 blocks to Main Street, 4 blocks to
the library, directly on the Streamline bus route. Walk
score: 82. Bike score: 78. This is one of the most
transit-friendly locations in Bozeman.

Rental potential: comparable units rent for $1,600-$1,750/
month. The building allows rentals with no minimum lease
restriction.

Offered at $275,000. Showings by appointment.
```

*Why it works: Building context, unit details, HOA transparency, rental data for investors, walkability scores, specific distances, no overclaiming on a modest property.*

### Example 3: Investment Property (MLS)

**Bad MLS Public Remarks:**
```
GREAT INVESTMENT! CASH COW! Both units rented! Positive
cash flow! Don't miss this amazing opportunity to build
wealth! Investor's dream! Won't last!
```

**Good MLS Public Remarks:**
```
Side-by-side duplex in Bozeman's university corridor.
Both units are 2 bed/1 bath, approximately 850 sq ft each.
Currently occupied by long-term tenants (Unit A lease
through May 2027, Unit B lease through May 2027). Combined
gross rent: $2,400/month. Separate utilities (electric,
gas). Shared water/sewer (landlord-paid, ~$85/month).
New roof (2024), updated electrical panels (2023), off-
street parking for 4 vehicles. Each unit has independent
HVAC, separate entrances, and in-unit laundry hookups.
Vacancy rate in this corridor: under 2%. Investor packet
with full financials available upon request with proof
of funds or pre-approval. Offered at $289,000.
```

**Good MLS Agent Remarks:**
```
Investor-ready. Full rent roll, maintenance history, and
P&L available. Both tenants wish to stay. Showings require
48-hr notice through ShowingTime — please respect tenants'
privacy. Offers due Friday 3/21 at 5 PM. Pre-approval or
proof of funds required. Co-op: 2.5%. Seller prefers
30-day close, flexible on possession.
```

## Writing the First Sentence

The first sentence of your listing description matters more than any other because:
1. It appears in search result previews (the only text visible before clicking)
2. Search algorithms weight early text more heavily
3. It sets the reader's expectations for quality

**First-sentence formulas that work:**

**Property Type + Location + Differentiator:**
```
Move-in ready 3-bedroom ranch in Bozeman's sought-after
Meadowlark neighborhood, updated throughout and walking
distance to Lindley Park.
```

**Lifestyle + Location + Property Type:**
```
Single-level living at its best — this 3-bedroom ranch
in Meadowlark puts you within walking distance of Lindley
Park, the co-op, and downtown Bozeman.
```

**Feature + Property Type + Location:**
```
Fully renovated kitchen, mountain views, and a private
fenced yard highlight this 3-bedroom ranch in Bozeman's
Meadowlark neighborhood.
```

**First sentences to avoid:**
```
"Welcome to your dream home!" (generic, not searchable)
"This is the one you've been looking for!" (meaningless)
"Beautiful home in great location!" (no keywords, no specifics)
"Must see to appreciate!" (cliche, provides no information)
```
