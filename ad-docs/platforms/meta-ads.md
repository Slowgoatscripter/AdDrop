# Meta Ads (Paid) Real Estate Copy Guide

## Platform Overview

Meta Ads span Facebook and Instagram's paid placements — News Feed, Stories, Reels, Marketplace, Audience Network, and Messenger. Unlike organic social posts, Meta Ads are interrupt-based: users did not ask to see your content. Your copy must earn attention in under 2 seconds, then deliver enough value to drive a click or lead form submission.

The copy constraints are tighter than organic posts, the stakes are higher (you're paying per impression), and the rules are different. This guide covers paid ad copy specifically — not organic posting.

## Format Constraints

| Element | Limit | Best Practice |
|---------|-------|---------------|
| Primary text | 125 characters before "See more" | Front-load the value proposition |
| Primary text (full) | 2,200 characters max | Most users won't expand |
| Headline | 40 characters | Below the image/video — the click trigger |
| Description | 30 characters | Below headline — supporting context |
| CTA button | Predefined options | "Learn More", "Book Now", "Get Quote", etc. |
| Image text | <20% of image area | Facebook may reduce delivery if text-heavy |

### The Three-Layer System

Meta Ads have three distinct text areas that work together:

1. **Primary text** (above the image): The hook and story. 125 visible characters.
2. **Headline** (below the image): The value proposition or offer. 40 characters.
3. **Description** (below headline): Supporting detail. 30 characters.

Each layer has a different job. Don't repeat yourself across layers — each one should add new information.

## Best Practices

### 1. The 125-Character Preview is Your Entire Ad

For most users, the primary text preview is the only copy they'll read. Treat the first 125 characters as a complete advertisement — it should contain:

- A hook that stops the scroll
- The core value proposition
- Enough to make the headline below the image make sense

**Strong 125-character openings:**

```
3 beds, mountain views, under $450K. This Bozeman listing just dropped and it won't sit long. (93 chars)
```

```
What does $350K buy you in Bozeman right now? More than you'd think. (67 chars)
```

```
Just listed: the only ranch under $500K in Meadowlark this year. 3 bed, updated everything. (92 chars)
```

```
Your Bozeman home search just got easier. New listings daily, private tours same-day. (85 chars)
```

### 2. Thumb-Stopping Copy Patterns

Users scroll Meta feeds with their thumb. You need to "stop the thumb" — create a pattern interrupt that makes the user pause.

**Thumb-stopping techniques:**

- **Specificity**: "742 Birch St just listed at $485,000" beats "Beautiful home for sale"
- **Contrast**: "Looks like $600K. Listed at $425K." creates a gap that demands attention
- **Direct address**: "Looking for a 3-bed in Bozeman under $500K?" qualifies the reader instantly
- **Bold claim**: "The best backyard in Meadowlark just hit the market."
- **Social proof**: "47 showings in 3 days. Here's why this Bozeman home is going fast."
- **Scarcity**: "Only 2 homes under $400K in Bozeman right now. This is one of them."

### 3. The 40-Character Headline

The headline appears below the image — it's what the user reads right before deciding whether to click. It must be a clear, compelling reason to take action.

**Headline formula: Benefit + Action or Benefit + Specificity**

| Good Headlines | Chars | Why It Works |
|---------------|-------|--------------|
| Tour This Home Before It Sells | 30 | Urgency + CTA |
| 3 Bed in Bozeman | $485K | 27 | Key details at a glance |
| Your Dream Home Just Listed | 27 | Aspirational + timely |
| See Inside 742 Birch Street | 28 | Specific + curiosity |
| Move-In Ready | Meadowlark | 27 | Benefit + location |
| Open House This Saturday | 24 | Event + urgency |
| Bozeman Homes From $350K | 25 | Price anchor + location |
| Schedule Your Private Showing | 30 | CTA + exclusivity |

**Bad Headlines:**

| Bad Headlines | Why It Fails |
|--------------|-------------|
| "Click Here" | No information, no value |
| "You Won't Believe This Home" | Clickbait, erodes trust |
| "Home For Sale" | Generic, zero differentiation |
| "AMAZING OPPORTUNITY!!!" | All caps, excessive punctuation |
| "Learn More About This Property" | Passive, no benefit |

### 4. The 30-Character Description

The description is the smallest text element and often overlooked by users. Use it for:

- Location: "Downtown Bozeman, MT" (20 chars)
- Qualifier: "Move-In Ready" (13 chars)
- Price: "Listed at $485,000" (18 chars)
- Urgency: "Open House Saturday" (19 chars)
- Trust: "5-Star Rated Agent" (18 chars)

Don't repeat what's in the headline. Add a new data point.

### 5. Social Proof Angles

Meta's social features make social proof particularly powerful. When users see their friends have liked or commented on a real estate ad, credibility transfers instantly.

**Social proof copy patterns:**

```
Primary: "200+ families found their Bozeman home with our team last year."
Headline: Find Yours — Browse Listings
Description: Trusted Local Expert
```

```
Primary: "This home had 12 showing requests in 24 hours. See what the buzz is about."
Headline: 742 Birch St | Just Listed
Description: Open House Saturday 10-12
```

```
Primary: "'Best agent we've worked with.' — The Martinez Family, Meadowlark"
Headline: Find Your Bozeman Home Today
Description: 150+ Five-Star Reviews
```

### 6. Benefit + CTA Formula

The most effective Meta Ad copy follows a simple pattern:

**Primary text**: Hook + benefit + supporting detail
**Headline**: Benefit or offer + CTA verb
**Description**: Location, price, or trust signal
**CTA button**: Matches the action (Learn More, Book Now, etc.)

**Example:**

```
Primary: "3-bed ranch in Meadowlark with a brand new kitchen and mountain
views — listed at $485K. Open house this Saturday or schedule a private tour."

Headline: Tour This Bozeman Home Today
Description: Meadowlark | Move-In Ready
CTA Button: Book Now
```

Every element adds information. Nothing repeats. The path from interest to action is clear.

## Ad Objectives & Copy Alignment

Different campaign objectives require different copy approaches:

### Traffic Campaigns (Drive to Listing Page)
- Primary text: Sell the click, not the house
- Headline: What they'll find when they click
- CTA: "Learn More" or "See Listing"
- Copy focus: Curiosity, specificity, value

### Lead Generation (Lead Form)
- Primary text: Qualify the reader (price range, location, buyer type)
- Headline: What they'll get (tour, info packet, market report)
- CTA: "Get Quote" or "Sign Up"
- Copy focus: Exchange value — what do they get for their info?

### Engagement (Boost Post)
- Primary text: Storytelling, community, shareable content
- Headline: Usually auto-pulled from link
- CTA: "Learn More"
- Copy focus: Comments, shares, reactions — organic reach multiplier

### Retargeting (Warm Audience)
- Primary text: Acknowledge prior interest ("Still looking in Bozeman?")
- Headline: New information or urgency
- CTA: "Book Now" or "Learn More"
- Copy focus: Progression — move them from browsing to acting

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

### 1. The Generic Scroll-Past
"Beautiful home for sale in a great neighborhood!" — This ad gets scrolled past 100% of the time. Nothing is specific enough to stop the thumb.

### 2. Feature Dumping in Primary Text
"3 bed 2 bath 1920 sqft hardwood floors granite counters stainless steel appliances fenced yard 2 car garage" — This is a database query result, not an ad. Pick the 2-3 features that matter most and make them benefits.

### 3. Repeating Across Layers
Primary: "Beautiful home in Bozeman"
Headline: "Bozeman Home for Sale"
Description: "Home in Bozeman MT"
Every layer says the same thing. Each should add unique information.

### 4. Clickbait Headlines
"You Won't BELIEVE What This Home Looks Like Inside!" — This erodes trust, gets low-quality clicks, and increases cost per lead. Promise real value, not manufactured curiosity.

### 5. Ignoring Mobile Display
Over 90% of Meta Ad impressions are on mobile. Test how your copy looks on a phone screen. Long primary text gets buried, headlines can wrap awkwardly, and descriptions often get cut off completely.

### 6. Missing the CTA Alignment
If your CTA button says "Book Now" but your copy says "Learn more about this neighborhood," there's a disconnect. The copy and button must promise the same thing.

### 7. Housing Discrimination
Meta has Special Ad Categories for housing. You cannot target by age, gender, ZIP code (only 15-mile radius), or use language that implies preference for protected classes. Copy must be inclusive. Never use language like "perfect for young professionals" or "ideal family neighborhood" in ways that exclude.

## Good vs Bad Examples

### Example 1: Single Listing Ad

**Bad:**
```
Primary: Beautiful home for sale! Don't miss this amazing opportunity
to own your dream home! This stunning property has everything you need!

Headline: Amazing Home For Sale
Description: Call Now
CTA: Learn More
```

*Problems: No specifics (location, price, features), empty superlatives, headline repeats primary, description wastes space, CTA doesn't match "Call Now" description.*

**Good:**
```
Primary: Just listed: 3 bed, 2 bath ranch in Meadowlark — $485K.
New kitchen, mountain views, walk to Lindley Park. Open house
Saturday 10 AM or schedule a private tour.

Headline: Tour 742 Birch St This Weekend
Description: Meadowlark, Bozeman
CTA: Book Now
```

*Why it works: Specific address, price, key features, location context, event urgency, every layer adds unique info, CTA matches the action.*

### Example 2: Lead Generation Campaign

**Bad:**
```
Primary: Are you looking to buy a home? We can help! Fill out the
form below and one of our agents will contact you about available
properties in your area!

Headline: Find Your Dream Home
Description: Contact Us Today
CTA: Sign Up
```

*Problems: Vague, no location, no value exchange, "dream home" is overused, "your area" is meaningless in a targeted ad.*

**Good:**
```
Primary: Searching for homes in Bozeman under $500K? We update our
off-market list every Monday. Drop your info below and get this
week's list — 3-5 homes not on Zillow yet.

Headline: Get Off-Market Bozeman Listings
Description: Free Weekly List
CTA: Get Quote
```

*Why it works: Qualifies by price and location, clear value exchange (their info for off-market listings), specific cadence (weekly), differentiator (not on Zillow).*

### Example 3: Retargeting Ad

**Bad:**
```
Primary: We noticed you were looking at homes! Come back and see
what's new! We have lots of great options!

Headline: Come Back and See
Description: New Listings Available
CTA: Learn More
```

*Problems: Generic retargeting language, no specific value, no urgency, no reason to come back now.*

**Good:**
```
Primary: Still looking in Bozeman? Since your last visit, 4 new
homes listed under $450K — including one in Meadowlark that
won't last the weekend.

Headline: 4 New Bozeman Listings This Week
Description: Updated Today
CTA: Learn More
```

*Why it works: Acknowledges prior interest without being creepy, specific new information (4 new homes), urgency (won't last), price anchor.*

## A/B Testing Framework

Always run multiple ad variations. Test one variable at a time:

### Variables to Test

**Primary text:**
- Short (under 125 chars) vs long (expanding)
- Question hook vs statement hook
- Price-forward vs lifestyle-forward
- Social proof vs direct offer

**Headlines:**
- Benefit vs CTA
- With price vs without price
- Specific address vs neighborhood
- Urgency vs value

**Creative + Copy Alignment:**
- Interior photo + feature copy
- Exterior photo + lifestyle copy
- Video tour + short copy
- Carousel + multiple angles

### Testing Rules
1. Let each variation run for at least 48 hours before judging
2. Need at least 1,000 impressions per variation for statistical relevance
3. Optimize for your actual goal (leads, clicks) not vanity metrics (likes)
4. Kill underperformers, scale winners, then test new variations against the winner
