# Twitter (X) Real Estate Ad Copy Guide

## Platform Overview

Twitter is the platform of brevity, personality, and immediacy. Real estate on Twitter works differently than any other platform — the audience is smaller but more engaged, the format demands conciseness, and personality matters more than polish. A tweet that sounds like a press release will get ignored. A tweet that sounds like a person with interesting information will get noticed.

The 280-character limit is not a constraint — it's a discipline. It forces you to identify the single most compelling thing about a property and say it clearly.

---

## Format Constraints

| Element | Limit | Notes |
|---------|-------|-------|
| Tweet | 280 characters | Includes all text, spaces, punctuation |
| Link | 23 characters (t.co wrapping) | All links become 23 chars regardless of length |
| Hashtags | Count toward 280 limit | Each hashtag uses characters |
| Images | Up to 4 per tweet | Don't count toward character limit |
| Thread | Multiple tweets | First tweet must stand alone |
| Quote tweet | 280 chars + quoted content | Use for market commentary |
| Alt text | 1,000 characters | Describe the image for accessibility |

### Character Budget

With a link (23 chars) and a space before it, you have 256 characters for your message. With 2-3 hashtags averaging 15 characters each (including spaces), you're working with roughly 210-220 characters of actual copy.

That's approximately 30-40 words. Every single one matters.

## Best Practices

### 1. Punchy and Direct

Twitter rewards directness. Strip away every unnecessary word. Get to the point in the first line.

**Twitter-native phrasing:**
- Instead of "We are excited to announce that we have just listed a beautiful property at..." → "Just listed:"
- Instead of "If you're looking for a home in Bozeman, you should check out this amazing..." → "Bozeman. 3 bed. $425K. Just hit the market."
- Instead of "This home features an updated kitchen with..." → "This kitchen. (with photo)"

### 2. Key Stats First

Lead with the numbers that matter: beds, baths, price, and location. Twitter users scan quickly. Put the data up front and the editorial after.

**Stats-first pattern:**
```
3 bed | 2 bath | $485K | Meadowlark, Bozeman

Ranch with a new kitchen, mountain views, and a
backyard that actually feels private. Open house
Saturday.

[link]
```

**Stats woven into narrative:**
```
$485K for a move-in ready ranch in Meadowlark with
mountain views? In this market? Go see it Saturday.

[link]
```

Both work. The first is informational. The second has more personality. Match the property's positioning.

### 3. Link Placement

The link takes 23 characters. Place it strategically:

- **End of tweet** (most common): Copy does the selling, link is the action
- **After the hook** (for context): "Just listed in Bozeman [link] — 3 bed ranch, mountain views, under $500K"
- **Standalone with image**: Let the image sell, tweet provides minimal context, link for details

### 4. Hashtag Discipline (2-3 Max)

Twitter hashtags should be functional, not decorative. Use 2-3 maximum.

**Useful hashtags:**
- `#BozemanRealEstate` — location-specific, used by local buyers
- `#JustListed` — common search term
- `#OpenHouse` — timely, event-specific
- `#RealEstate` — broad but discoverable

**Avoid:**
- `#DreamHome` `#HomeGoals` `#LuxuryLiving` — aspirational tags that attract browsers, not buyers
- Stacking 5+ hashtags — it looks like spam on Twitter
- Creating unique hashtags nobody searches (`#742BirchStreet`)

**Placement:** End of tweet, after the link or on the same line. Never at the beginning of the tweet (it looks like a topic label, not a conversation).

### 5. Personality Shines

Twitter audiences connect with voice. An agent who sounds like a person — with opinions, humor, and genuine enthusiasm — outperforms an agent who sounds like a listing service.

**With personality:**
```
I've been in Bozeman real estate for 11 years and this
might be the best kitchen renovation I've seen in
Meadowlark. $485K. Go look at it.

[link]
```

**Without personality (weaker on Twitter):**
```
New listing at 742 Birch Street in Bozeman's Meadowlark
neighborhood. 3 bedrooms, 2 bathrooms, 1,680 sq ft.
Recently renovated kitchen. Offered at $485,000.

[link]
```

The first version tells you what the agent thinks. It carries credibility. The second is a fact sheet — useful but not memorable.

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

### 1. The Press Release
"[Company Name] is proud to announce the listing of a premium residential property located at 742 Birch Street in the prestigious Meadowlark community." Nobody talks like this. Twitter punishes formality.

### 2. Hashtag Soup
"#Bozeman #RealEstate #Home #ForSale #JustListed #DreamHome #MontanaLiving #MeadowlarkNeighborhood #3Bedroom #MountainViews" — This is unreadable and screams automated content.

### 3. The Auto-Post from Another Platform
Truncated Instagram captions or Facebook posts that cut off at 280 characters with no context. If you're cross-posting, rewrite for Twitter's format.

### 4. All Business, No Voice
Every tweet reading like a classified ad. Twitter users follow people, not listing feeds. Show your perspective, share your opinions about the market, react to things — then post listings within that human context.

### 5. Engagement Bait
"RT if you want to live here!" or "Like if you love mountain views!" — This generates empty engagement and annoys followers. Real engagement comes from interesting content, not requests.

### 6. Thread for Simple Listings
Don't thread a standard 3-bed ranch. Threads work for complex, interesting, or luxury properties that have a story to tell. A thread for a routine listing looks like you're trying too hard.

## Good vs Bad Examples

### Example 1: Just Listed

**Bad:**
```
New listing alert! Beautiful 3 bedroom 2 bathroom home
for sale in Bozeman Montana! Great location, great
neighborhood, great price! Don't miss out! Call us today
for more information! #realestate #homeforsale #bozeman
#montana #dreamhome #justlisted #openhouse #beautiful
```
(Over 280 chars, would be truncated. Hashtag overload, generic language, no price, no useful information.)

**Good:**
```
$485K in Meadowlark, Bozeman. 3 bed ranch with a brand
new kitchen and mountain views from the deck.

Open house Saturday 10-12.

[link] #BozemanRealEstate
```
(170 chars — concise, specific, actionable. Has price, location, key feature, event, and one relevant hashtag.)

### Example 2: Market Update

**Bad:**
```
The real estate market is doing great! If you're thinking
about buying or selling, now is a great time! Contact us
for more information about the current market conditions
in your area!
```
(No data, no specifics, no value. "Great" appears twice. Could be posted in any city at any time.)

**Good:**
```
Bozeman Q4 numbers:

Median sale: $542K (up 7% YoY)
Avg days on market: 14
Active inventory: 127 homes

Translation: still competitive, but more options than
last year. Buyers have slightly more leverage.

Full report: [link]
```
(246 chars — specific data, interpretation, and a resource link. This gets saved and shared.)

### Example 3: Personality-Driven

**Bad:**
```
We are the best real estate team in Bozeman! With years
of experience and hundreds of satisfied clients, we can
help you find your perfect home! Visit our website to
learn more!
```
(Self-promotional, no value for the reader, generic claims.)

**Good:**
```
An agent told their buyer "don't worry about the
inspection, the house looks fine."

The house had a cracked foundation.

Get an inspection. Always. I don't care how hot the
market is.

(This is not about a listing. This is a PSA.)
```
(Tells a story, provides value, shows the agent's character. This gets engagement and followers — and followers become clients.)

## Twitter-Specific Strategy Notes

### Timing
- Real estate tweets perform best Tuesday-Thursday, 10 AM - 2 PM local time
- Open house reminders: post the day before AND morning of
- Just listed: post immediately, then a follow-up 2 days later with different angle

### Engagement Rules
- Reply to every comment on your listing tweets
- Quote-tweet local news that affects real estate (development, school ratings, business openings)
- Don't auto-DM new followers with listing info — it's universally despised

### Content Mix
- 40% listings and real estate content
- 30% market insights and educational content
- 20% community and local content
- 10% personal/personality (appropriate — you're still a professional)

### Visual Strategy
- Always attach at least one photo to listing tweets (images get 150%+ more engagement)
- Lead with the best room or feature, not the front exterior
- For video, keep under 30 seconds — Twitter is not YouTube
- Aerial/drone shots perform well for properties with views or acreage
