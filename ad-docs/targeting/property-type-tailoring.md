# Property Type Tailoring Guide

## Overview

Different property types demand different vocabulary, different selling angles, and different things to avoid. A condo and a luxury estate may share a city, but they share almost nothing else in how they should be marketed. A multi-family investment property and a single-family home serve entirely different buyer needs and require entirely different copy approaches.

This guide covers six property types with specific vocabulary, selling points, anti-patterns, and example copy for each. Use this as a reference when generating ad copy to ensure the language, emphasis, and framing match the property type.

---

## Property Type 1: Condo / Apartment

### What You're Really Selling
Convenience, community, and low-maintenance urban living. Condo buyers are choosing a lifestyle — proximity to things they love, freedom from property maintenance, and often a price point that gets them into a desirable area they couldn't otherwise afford as a single-family buyer.

### Vocabulary

**Use:**
- Unit, residence, flat (for larger/luxury condos)
- Building, community, complex
- Amenities: gym, pool, rooftop, concierge, package room, bike storage
- In-unit: "in-unit laundry," "in-unit storage"
- Association / HOA: transparent about what's covered
- Walk score, bike score, transit score
- "Lock and leave" (for travel-oriented buyers)
- "Urban living," "walkable," "car-optional"
- Common areas, shared spaces, community room
- Secured entry, elevator access

**Avoid:**
- "Yard" or "private lot" (condos don't have these — don't promise what isn't there)
- "Sprawling" or "expansive" (condos are typically modest in size — own it)
- "Estate" or "compound" (absurd for a condo)
- "Acreage" (there is none)
- "Privacy" as a primary selling point (condos have neighbors — be honest)
- "House" (it's a unit; call it what it is)

### Key Selling Points

1. **Location efficiency**: "Two blocks from Main Street. Walk to work, walk to dinner, walk home."
2. **Maintenance freedom**: "The HOA handles snow, landscaping, and building maintenance. Your weekends are yours."
3. **Amenities**: "Gym in the building. No membership fees, no driving, just take the elevator."
4. **Financial entry point**: "Own in downtown Bozeman for under $300K."
5. **Community**: "40 units, 40 neighbors. The building hosts quarterly socials."
6. **Security**: "Secured entry, package room, and underground parking."

### Anti-Patterns
- Describing the condo as if it were a house (don't overstate the space)
- Ignoring HOA fees or being vague about what they cover (transparency builds trust)
- Failing to mention parking (parking is a major concern for condo buyers)
- Overselling square footage — instead, describe how the space is laid out and what fits
- Ignoring noise and neighbor proximity — address it by highlighting building quality: "concrete construction between units"

### Example Copy

```
Downtown Bozeman condo — $275,000

2 bed | 1 bath | 950 sq ft | The Bridger Building

The layout is smart: south-facing windows across the
living area, kitchen open to the dining and living room,
and both bedrooms large enough for real furniture (the
primary fits a king bed and nightstands).

In-unit washer/dryer. One parking spot underground. One
storage unit in the basement. Secured entry and elevator.

HOA: $285/mo — covers water, sewer, trash, snow, building
insurance, and reserves (fully funded per last study).

Walk score: 82. Two blocks to Main Street. On the
Streamline bus route. If you work downtown, this might
replace your car payment.

Comparable units rent at $1,650-$1,750/mo.
```

---

## Property Type 2: Single-Family Home

### What You're Really Selling
Space, privacy, autonomy, and neighborhood. The single-family home is the foundational American dream property. Buyers want their own four walls, their own yard, and the freedom to modify, expand, and personalize. They're also buying a neighborhood — the street, the neighbors, the school district.

### Vocabulary

**Use:**
- Home, house, property, residence
- Lot, yard, property line, setback
- Neighborhood, street, block, community
- Privacy, space, room to grow
- Garage, driveway, workshop
- Backyard, front porch, deck, patio
- Fenced, landscaped, mature trees
- School district (by name and rating)
- Curb appeal, street presence

**Avoid:**
- "Shared walls" or "shared amenities" (these are condo/townhouse concepts)
- "HOA restrictions" as a selling point (only mention HOA if it exists — and be transparent)
- "Unit" (it's a house, not a unit)
- "Common areas" (the yard IS the common area — and it's private)
- "Complex" or "building" (single-family language is about the property, not a structure with other units)

### Key Selling Points

1. **Space and privacy**: "0.22 acres, fully fenced. Your yard, your rules."
2. **Neighborhood character**: "The kind of street where kids ride bikes and you wave to the neighbors."
3. **School district**: "In the Hawthorne Elementary district — consistently rated among the top in the county."
4. **Customization potential**: "A two-car garage with room for a workbench, a detached shed with electricity, and an unfinished basement ready for your vision."
5. **Outdoor living**: "Covered patio, fire pit, and mountain views from the back deck."
6. **System updates**: "New roof (2024), new HVAC (2024), updated electrical. The big-ticket items are done."

### Anti-Patterns
- Describing every room without benefit context (room-by-room tours need "so what?" at each stop)
- Ignoring the neighborhood (buyers care as much about the street as the house)
- Listing dimensions without spatial context ("12x14 bedroom" — is that big? Help them)
- Failing to address known concerns (busy road, small lot, dated bathroom — reframe, don't hide)
- Using the same description template for every house (each home has a story)

### Example Copy

```
742 Birch Street | Meadowlark, Bozeman | $485,000

3 bed | 2 bath | 1,680 sq ft | 0.18 acre lot

A single-level ranch on a quiet street in one of
Bozeman's most walkable neighborhoods. The original
owners maintained and updated this home for 20 years
— the result is a property that feels both established
and fresh.

The kitchen was fully renovated in 2024: quartzite
counters, maple cabinetry, gas range, and an open
layout that connects to the dining and living areas.
Hardwood floors run throughout the main living spaces.

Out back: a fully fenced yard with mature trees,
automated irrigation, and a flagstone patio that
faces the Bridgers. This is the room that sells the
house — it just happens to be outside.

Two-car garage with built-in storage, EV outlet, and
workbench space. The basement is partial, dry, and
provides 400 sq ft of additional storage.

Walk to Lindley Park (5 min), downtown (10 min), and
the co-op (3 min). Hawthorne Elementary is 0.8 miles.

Open house Saturday 10-12 or by appointment.
```

## Property Type 3: Luxury Estate

### What You're Really Selling
An experience, a legacy, and a statement. Luxury estates aren't marketed on bed count and square footage — they're marketed on what it feels like to live there. The buyer is purchasing a way of life: privacy, craftsmanship, setting, and the knowledge that very few properties like this exist.

### Vocabulary

**Use:**
- Estate, residence, property, compound
- Grounds, acreage, setting, landscape
- Craftsmanship, provenance, bespoke, commissioned
- Architectural, designed, considered, intentional
- Primary suite, guest wing, staff quarters
- Gallery, great room, library, study, conservatory
- Terrace, veranda, loggia, porte-cochere, motor court
- Materials by name: Douglas fir, Montana moss rock, Calacatta marble, walnut, limestone
- Sensory: light, texture, warmth, silence, vista

**Avoid:**
- "Affordable" (never)
- "Starter home" (insulting for this category)
- "Cute" or "cozy" (diminishing)
- "Deal" or "bargain" (luxury has no bargains)
- "HOA" or "monthly fees" (estate buyers don't care about $200/month)
- "Close to shopping" (luxury estates sell seclusion, not convenience)
- "Attached garage" (use "motor court" or "private garage")
- Feature dumps without narrative context
- Price per square foot (estates are not commodities)

### Key Selling Points

1. **Setting**: "Twelve acres of river frontage where the cottonwoods thin and the valley opens."
2. **Architecture**: "Designed by [architect name] with a sensitivity to the Montana landscape."
3. **Craftsmanship**: "Timbers sourced from a single stand of reclaimed Douglas fir. Stone quarried on the property."
4. **Privacy**: "A mile of private road. No neighbors visible. Complete seclusion."
5. **Unique features**: "A wine cellar carved from the foundation stone. A lap pool set into the hillside."
6. **Legacy**: "A property to hold, to shape, and to pass forward."

### Anti-Patterns
- Listing every room and feature without narrative (this is not a listing description — it's a story)
- Using exclamation marks (luxury never shouts)
- Comparing to other properties (luxury is singular — it doesn't compete)
- Overselling with superlatives ("the most stunning, breathtaking, magnificent...") — one is enough
- Including price per square foot or financial analysis (this audience doesn't think that way)
- Using casual language or emoji (ever)

### Example Copy

```
Where the timber meets the meadow and the Gallatin
bends toward the mountains, a residence of uncommon
restraint occupies twelve acres of Montana's most
coveted landscape.

The architecture is deliberate. Hand-hewn timbers from
a single stand of reclaimed Douglas fir. Walls of glass
that frame the river's course. Stone gathered from the
property's own creek bed. Nothing here is incidental.

Five bedrooms, each oriented to a different aspect of
the property. A kitchen anchored by a twelve-foot walnut
island. A private wing for guests. A screening room with
acoustic treatment. A lap pool with a vanishing edge that
mirrors the ridgeline beyond.

Outside, the grounds unfold in layers — formal gardens
giving way to native meadow, then timber, then river.
A guest cabin sits at the far boundary, private enough
to feel separate, close enough to remain connected.

One of three riverfront parcels remaining in the valley.

$3,200,000 | Private viewings by arrangement

## Property Type 4: Townhouse

### What You're Really Selling
The hybrid: the space and multi-level living of a house, with the maintenance benefits of a condo. Townhouse buyers want more than a condo but aren't ready for (or don't want) the full maintenance responsibility of a single-family home. They value space, a private entrance, and often an attached garage — while appreciating that someone else handles the snow and the landscaping.

### Vocabulary

**Use:**
- Townhouse, townhome, row home
- Multi-level living, three levels, split-level
- Attached garage, private entrance, private patio/deck
- End unit (premium — means fewer shared walls and more light)
- HOA with transparency about what's included
- "Best of both worlds" (condo convenience + house space)
- Rooftop deck (if applicable — a major selling point)
- Private outdoor space (even if small — emphasize it)

**Avoid:**
- "Cramped" or "narrow" (address the vertical layout positively — "multi-level living distributes space across floors")
- "Shared" without context (be specific: "one shared wall with the neighboring unit" is honest; "shared everything" is misleading)
- "Apartment" (townhouses are not apartments)
- "Condo" (unless it's legally a condo — check the ownership structure)
- "Detached" (if it's not — be accurate)
- Language about large yards or extensive grounds (townhouse outdoor spaces are typically modest)

### Key Selling Points

1. **Multi-level layout**: "Living room and kitchen on the main level. Bedrooms upstairs. Garage and rec room below. Everyone gets their own floor."
2. **Private entrance**: "Your own front door. No shared hallways. No elevator. Just walk in."
3. **Garage**: "Attached one-car garage — pull in from the rain, walk straight into the house."
4. **Outdoor space**: "A private deck off the kitchen and a small fenced patio below — enough for a grill, a table, and a garden."
5. **Maintenance included**: "HOA covers exterior maintenance, snow removal, and landscaping. You take care of the inside."
6. **End unit premium**: "End unit means extra windows, more natural light, and only one shared wall."

### Anti-Patterns
- Pretending the townhouse is a single-family home (be honest about the format)
- Ignoring the vertical layout challenge (stairs are a factor — own it and frame positively)
- Failing to specify end unit vs. interior unit (end units command premium for a reason)
- Being vague about HOA coverage (what's included and what's the owner's responsibility)
- Not addressing noise between units (if construction quality is good, say so)

### Example Copy

```
The best of both worlds in Bozeman — $389,000

3 bed | 2.5 bath | 1,650 sq ft | End Unit

This end-unit townhome in Westgate gives you house-level
space without house-level maintenance. Three levels of
living, each with a purpose:

Ground level: attached one-car garage, laundry room, and
a rec room/flex space that opens to a small fenced patio.

Main level: open kitchen and living room with vaulted
ceilings and a private deck. The end-unit position means
windows on three sides — this floor is flooded with light
all day.

Upper level: 3 bedrooms, including a primary with en-suite
bath and walk-in closet. The two secondary bedrooms share
the hall bath with a double vanity.

One shared wall (well-insulated — you'll forget it's there).
Private entrance, private garage, private outdoor space.

HOA: $225/mo — covers exterior maintenance, roof, snow
removal, landscaping, and building insurance.

Walk to downtown Bozeman in 12 minutes. Dog park two blocks
away. On the Streamline route.

Open house Sunday 1-3 PM or schedule a private tour.
```

## Property Type 5: Land / Lots

### What You're Really Selling
Potential. Land buyers aren't buying what exists — they're buying what could exist. Your copy must paint the picture of possibility: what can be built, what the setting offers, and what infrastructure is already in place. You're selling a canvas, not a painting.

### Vocabulary

**Use:**
- Parcel, lot, acreage, tract
- Views, exposure, aspect, elevation, topography
- Zoning: residential, commercial, agricultural, mixed-use
- Utilities: water, sewer, electric, gas, internet — specify what's available vs. what needs to be brought in
- Building envelope, setbacks, easements
- Perc test, well permit, septic approval (if completed — huge selling points)
- Access: paved road, county road, year-round access
- Potential: home site, development, agriculture, conservation
- Natural features: creek, trees, meadow, ridge, bench, slope

**Avoid:**
- Interior language: bedrooms, bathrooms, kitchen, living room (there is no interior)
- Room descriptions of any kind
- "Home" unless you're discussing building potential: "the future home site"
- "Cozy" or "charming" (it's land)
- "Move-in ready" (there's nothing to move into)
- "Updated" or "renovated" (there's nothing to update)
- "Walk to" (land is often rural — proximity language should use driving times)
- Describing features that don't exist yet as if they do

### Key Selling Points

1. **Views and setting**: "360-degree mountain views from the ridge. The Bridgers to the east, the Tobacco Roots to the west."
2. **Zoning and potential**: "Zoned residential with approval for a single-family home up to 4,000 sq ft."
3. **Utilities**: "Power and water at the property line. Perc test completed and approved for conventional septic."
4. **Access**: "Year-round access via paved county road. The driveway is roughed in to the building site."
5. **Acreage and privacy**: "20 acres with no covenants. Build what you want, where you want."
6. **Location context**: "15 minutes to Bozeman, 25 minutes to Big Sky. Close enough to be convenient, far enough to be quiet."

### Anti-Patterns
- Writing the ad as if a home already exists ("Imagine the kitchen you could build here..." — just describe the land)
- Ignoring utility availability (this is the #1 concern for land buyers)
- Failing to mention zoning and restrictions
- Being vague about access ("easy access" — is it paved? Is it year-round? Can a concrete truck get there?)
- Not mentioning perc test or well status (land without septic and water approval is significantly less valuable)
- Overusing "potential" without specifics (what kind of potential? For what?)

### Example Copy

```
20 Acres | Gallatin Valley | $425,000

The building site sits on a natural bench at 5,200 feet
with unobstructed views of the Bridger Range to the east
and the Gallatin Valley floor below. Morning sun from
the moment it clears the ridge.

The parcel is zoned residential — no covenants, no HOA,
no architectural review. Build the home you actually want.

What's done:
- Perc test: completed and approved (conventional septic)
- Well permit: in hand
- Power: at the property line (NorthWestern Energy)
- Access: year-round via paved county road, with a
  roughed-in driveway to the building site
- Survey: completed and staked

What you'll need:
- Well drilling (estimated depth: 180-220 ft based on
  neighboring properties)
- Septic installation
- Driveway completion and landscaping

The land is a mix of native grass meadow and scattered
Douglas fir, with a seasonal creek along the eastern
boundary. Wildlife is constant — elk, deer, and the
occasional moose.

15 minutes to Bozeman. 25 minutes to Big Sky. 5 minutes
to the nearest trailhead.

This is one of the last 20-acre parcels in this corridor
without covenants.

Full survey, perc test, and utility documentation
available. Call to walk the property: (406) 555-0123.
```

## Property Type 6: Multi-Family

### What You're Really Selling
Income. Multi-family properties are investment vehicles first and buildings second. The buyer cares about the rent roll, the expenses, the cap rate, and the market conditions that support continued returns. Your copy should be a financial overview with enough property context to validate the numbers.

### Vocabulary

**Use:**
- Duplex, triplex, fourplex, multi-family, multi-unit
- Units (by count and configuration)
- Rent roll, gross rent, NOI (net operating income)
- Cap rate, cash-on-cash return, GRM (gross rent multiplier)
- Occupancy rate, vacancy rate
- Lease terms, tenant history, turnover
- Separate utilities (major plus — means less owner expense)
- Unit mix, bedroom count per unit
- Value-add (if there's improvement potential)
- Pro forma, financials, investor packet

**Avoid:**
- Single-family language: "dream home," "forever home," "your perfect place"
- "Cozy" or "charming" (investors don't care about charm — they care about rent)
- Emotional appeals: "fall in love with this property" (investors don't fall in love)
- Excessive interior descriptions (keep it functional: bed count, bath count, appliances, condition)
- Vague financial claims: "great cash flow," "amazing returns" (show the numbers or don't mention them)
- "Motivated seller" (signals problems to sophisticated investors)

### Key Selling Points

1. **Current income**: "$4,200/month gross rent across 3 units. All occupied."
2. **Cap rate**: "7.1% cap rate at current rents. Market rents suggest 8.2% upside."
3. **Tenant stability**: "Average tenant tenure: 3.2 years. Zero vacancy in the last 18 months."
4. **Separate utilities**: "All utilities separate — electric, gas, water. Tenants pay their own."
5. **Low deferred maintenance**: "New roof (2024), updated electrical (2023), exterior paint (2024). Major capex is behind you."
6. **Market context**: "Bozeman rental vacancy: 1.8%. Average rent growth: 6% YoY. Demand outpaces supply."

### Anti-Patterns
- Writing the ad as if it's a home for sale (it's a business for sale)
- Hiding negative financials (the buyer will find them during due diligence — better to address upfront)
- Describing interior aesthetics extensively (condition matters; design doesn't for income property)
- Using "potential" without supporting it with market data
- Failing to mention lease terms and tenant status (buyers need to know what they're inheriting)
- Marketing to owner-occupants when the property is purely an investment (and vice versa)

### Owner-Occupant Angle (House Hacking)
For duplexes and triplexes, there's a secondary audience: buyers who will live in one unit and rent the others. This requires a blended approach — address the lifestyle of the owner-occupied unit AND the financials of the rental units.

```
Live in one, rent the other. Your mortgage payment
just got a lot more manageable.

Side-by-side duplex in Bozeman's university corridor.
Both units are 2 bed/1 bath. Move into Unit A, keep
Unit B rented at $1,200/month. Your effective housing
cost drops to under $800/month with a conventional
loan at current rates.
```
