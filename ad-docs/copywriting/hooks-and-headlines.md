# Hooks and Headlines Guide

## Overview

The headline is the ad. Research consistently shows that 80% of people read the headline and only 20% read the body copy. In real estate advertising, the headline determines whether someone stops scrolling, flips the postcard over, or clicks through to the listing. A great headline paired with mediocre body copy will outperform mediocre headline with great body copy every time.

This guide covers headline formulas, opening patterns, and platform-specific strategies for real estate ad copy.

## The "8 Words or Fewer" Rule

The most effective headlines contain 8 words or fewer. Beyond 8 words, comprehension drops, impact dilutes, and the reader's eye moves on before processing the full message.

This doesn't mean every headline must be under 8 words — but the core message should be. If you need more words, the first 8 should carry the entire meaning, and additional words should only add detail.

**Under 8 words (high impact):**
- "Just Listed in Meadowlark" (4 words)
- "The View From This Deck" (5 words)
- "$485K. Mountain Views. Move-In Ready." (5 words)
- "Your Next Home Just Hit the Market" (7 words)
- "The Best Kitchen in Meadowlark" (5 words)
- "What $350K Buys in Bozeman" (5 words)

**Over 8 words (lower impact, still usable):**
- "A Fully Updated Ranch in the Heart of Meadowlark" (9 words — core message in first 6)
- "This Might Be the Best Value in Bozeman Right Now" (10 words — but the hook is in the first 8)

**Way over (avoid):**
- "Check Out This Beautiful Three Bedroom Two Bathroom Home That Just Came on the Market in the Meadowlark Neighborhood of Bozeman Montana" (22 words — this is a sentence, not a headline)

## Headline Formulas

### 1. Number Hooks

Numbers create specificity and scannability. The brain processes numbers faster than words, making them natural scroll-stoppers.

**Formulas:**
- "[Number] [Things] [That Make This Home Worth Seeing]"
- "[Number] Reasons [This Property Stands Out]"
- "$[Price] | [Beds] Bed | [Location]"
- "[Number] Homes Sold in [Area] This Month"

**Examples:**
```
3 Things That Set This Ranch Apart
5 Homes Under $400K in Bozeman Right Now
$485,000 | 3 Bed | Meadowlark
12 Days on Market — Average in Meadowlark
4 Acres, Mountain Views, Under $600K
2,400 Sq Ft of Move-In Ready Living
```

**Why numbers work:**
- They create a concrete expectation (the reader knows what they're getting)
- They imply a list (lists are easy to scan)
- Dollar amounts immediately qualify or intrigue
- They stand out visually in a feed of text

### 2. Question Hooks

Questions activate the reader's brain differently than statements. A well-crafted question creates a gap between what the reader knows and what they want to know — and the only way to close that gap is to keep reading.

**Formulas:**
- "What Does $[Price] Buy in [Location]?"
- "Looking for [Feature] in [Area]?"
- "Is This the Best [Feature] in [Neighborhood]?"
- "Ready to [Lifestyle Benefit] in [Location]?"
- "Know What Your [Neighborhood] Home Is Worth?"

**Examples:**
```
What Does $350K Buy in Bozeman Right Now?
Still Searching for a 3-Bed Under $500K?
Is This the Best Backyard in Meadowlark?
Ready for Mountain Views Every Morning?
What If Your Commute Was a 10-Minute Walk?
Know How Many Homes Sold on Your Street?
```

**Rules for question hooks:**
- The reader should be able to answer "yes" or "I want to know" instantly
- Never ask a question the reader can dismiss with "no" and move on
- The answer should be in your copy (don't ask and then not deliver)
- Avoid rhetorical questions that feel like sales tactics: "Don't you deserve the best?"

### 3. Location Hooks

For real estate, location is often the most compelling element. Lead with location when the area carries inherent desirability, scarcity, or curiosity value.

**Formulas:**
- "In the Heart of [Neighborhood]"
- "[Distance] From [Landmark]"
- "[Location]: The Neighborhood That Has Everything"
- "The Last Lot on [Street Name]"
- "[Neighborhood] Just Got a New Listing"

**Examples:**
```
Two Blocks From Main Street, Bozeman
Meadowlark: Where Bozeman Buyers Want to Be
On the Banks of the Gallatin River
The Last Ranch Available in Westridge
Right Across From Lindley Park
742 Birch Street — Meadowlark's Best-Kept Secret
```

**When to use location hooks:**
- The neighborhood name carries recognition and desirability
- Proximity to a landmark is a genuine differentiator
- The location is more compelling than the property's features
- You're targeting buyers who already want that area

### 4. Feature Hooks

Lead with a specific feature when the property has something genuinely standout — something that distinguishes it from comparable listings.

**Formulas:**
- "The [Feature] You've Been Looking For"
- "[Feature] + [Feature] + Under $[Price]"
- "Finally: A [Feature] in [Location]"
- "This [Feature] Changes Everything"

**Examples:**
```
The Kitchen That Sells the House
Mountain Views + 3 Acres + Under $600K
A Real Home Office — Not a Converted Closet
This Backyard Has Its Own Creek
40-Foot Ceilings and Walls of Glass
Brand New Everything — at a Resale Price
```

**Rules for feature hooks:**
- The feature must be genuinely distinctive (not "updated kitchen" — 60% of listings claim that)
- The feature should be immediately visible in the accompanying photo
- Don't feature-hook on something basic — reserve this for true standouts
- "Brand new roof" is not a hook. "The best kitchen renovation you'll see this year" is.

## Opening Patterns That Grab Attention

Beyond the headline itself, the first 1-2 sentences of your copy must sustain the momentum. Here are opening patterns organized by effectiveness.

### Pattern 1: Specific > Generic (The Single Most Important Rule)

Every great opening is specific. Every weak opening is generic. This is the dividing line.

| Generic (Weak) | Specific (Strong) |
|-----------------|-------------------|
| "Beautiful home for sale" | "742 Birch Street just hit the market at $485K" |
| "Great neighborhood" | "Walk to Lindley Park in 5 minutes" |
| "Updated throughout" | "New kitchen (2024), new HVAC, 5-year-old roof" |
| "Amazing views" | "Watch the sunset behind the Bridgers from your back deck" |
| "Don't miss this one" | "12 showings booked in the first 24 hours" |
| "Perfect for families" | "In the Hawthorne Elementary district, rated 8/10" |

### Pattern 2: The Contrast Open

Set up a contrast between expectation and reality to create surprise.

```
Looks like $600K. Listed at $425K.

Most renovations cut corners somewhere. This one didn't.
Floor to ceiling, the previous owners invested $120K in
updates and it shows in every room...
```

```
Three blocks from downtown. Somehow, completely private.

742 Birch Street sits on a tree-lined cul-de-sac where the
only traffic is the neighbors walking their dogs...
```

### Pattern 3: The Bold Claim Open

Make a confident statement about the property, then prove it with details.

```
The best kitchen renovation in Meadowlark this year.

I've toured 40+ homes in this neighborhood in 2026
and nothing comes close to what the sellers did here.
Custom maple cabinetry, quartzite waterfall island,
integrated appliances, and pendant lighting that
was actually designed for the space — not just picked
from a catalog...
```

**Rule:** If you make a bold claim, you must back it up immediately. A bold claim without evidence is just bragging.

### Pattern 4: The Lifestyle Lead

Open with a moment or experience, not a fact sheet.

```
Morning coffee on the back deck. Mountains in front of you.
Quiet street behind you. Nobody rushing anywhere.

That's the daily routine at 742 Birch Street...
```

```
Dinner parties that start in the kitchen and spill out
onto the patio. The kind of home where people stay late
because the setting is too good to leave.

That's what the sellers built here...
```

### Pattern 5: The Data Open

Lead with a surprising or compelling data point.

```
Median home price in Meadowlark: $492,000.
This one: $425,000. New kitchen. New roof.
Same neighborhood.

Here's why the number works...
```

```
47 homes sold in Meadowlark this year.
Average days on market: 14.
Average sale-to-list ratio: 101.2%.

If you've been waiting for the right time, the
market is telling you something...
```

## Platform-Specific Hook Strategies

### Instagram Hooks (125 characters)
The hook IS the caption preview. It must work in isolation.

| Type | Hook | Chars |
|------|------|-------|
| Price anchor | "$485K in Meadowlark. Yes, with that kitchen." | 46 |
| Question | "What does $350K get you in Bozeman? More than you'd think." | 59 |
| Bold claim | "The best backyard in Meadowlark just hit the market." | 53 |
| Lifestyle | "Morning coffee with mountain views. Every single day." | 53 |
| Scarcity | "Only 3 homes under $400K in Bozeman right now. This is one." | 60 |
| Data | "12 showings in 24 hours. This Meadowlark ranch is moving." | 58 |

### Facebook Hooks (125 characters, "See more")
Same truncation point as Instagram, but Facebook users are more likely to click "See more" — so the hook can create a stronger information gap.

```
"When we first walked into this house, the sellers told us
they'd raised three kids here. You can see it —" (See more)
```

```
"I get asked this every week: 'Is it possible to buy in
downtown Bozeman under $300K?' Here's the answer:" (See more)
```

### Google Ads Headlines (30 characters)
Pure efficiency. No room for anything but the core message.

```
Bozeman Homes From $350K (24)
3 Bed Ranch | Meadowlark (25)
Tour Bozeman Homes Today (24)
Mountain View Home $485K (23)
```

### Twitter Hooks (within 280 total)
Lead with the data point or opinion, not the announcement.

```
"$485K in Meadowlark. New kitchen, mountain views, walk
to everything. This one's going to go fast." (99 chars for link + hashtags)
```

### Postcard Headlines (60 characters)
Must be readable from arm's length. Big, bold, impactful.

```
Just Listed on Birch Street — $485,000 (38)
Your Neighbor's Home Sold for $520K (35)
3 Homes Sold on Your Street This Year (37)
What's Your Meadowlark Home Worth? (34)
```

### Magazine Headlines (40-60 characters)
Must work at three reading distances (far, medium, close).

```
On the Banks of the Gallatin (27)
A Residence Unlike Any Other (28)
Where the Mountain Meets the Meadow (35)
Twelve Acres. Complete Privacy. (30)
```

### Listing Platform First Lines (~170 characters)
SEO-conscious, informative, keyword-rich.

```
Move-in ready 3-bedroom, 2-bath ranch in Bozeman's Meadowlark
neighborhood, fully updated and walking distance to Lindley Park
and downtown. (142)
```

## Good vs Bad Examples (Comprehensive)

### Example 1: Price-Driven

**Bad:** "Amazing deal!"
**Good:** "$349,900 in Midtown. And yes, that kitchen is brand new."
**Why:** Specific price, specific location, specific feature — earns the click.

### Example 2: Location-Driven

**Bad:** "Great location close to everything!"
**Good:** "Two blocks from Main Street. Walk to dinner, walk home."
**Why:** Specific distance, specific benefit, lifestyle image.

### Example 3: Feature-Driven

**Bad:** "Updated home with many features!"
**Good:** "This kitchen has a 10-foot island and a view of the Bridgers."
**Why:** Specific feature with a specific detail creates a mental image.

### Example 4: Urgency-Driven

**Bad:** "Won't last long! Act now!"
**Good:** "12 showings booked in the first 24 hours. Saturday open house is your chance."
**Why:** Social proof creates urgency naturally, without pressure language.

### Example 5: Lifestyle-Driven

**Bad:** "Perfect for entertaining!"
**Good:** "The kind of backyard where guests stay for hours and no one wants to leave."
**Why:** Paints a picture. The reader imagines themselves hosting.

### Example 6: Market-Driven

**Bad:** "The market is hot!"
**Good:** "Median price in Meadowlark hit $492K this month. This home is listed at $425K."
**Why:** Data creates a clear value gap. The reader's instinct is "that's a good deal."

### Example 7: Investment-Driven

**Bad:** "Great investment opportunity!"
**Good:** "$2,400/month gross rent. $289K asking price. Both units occupied through 2027."
**Why:** Numbers. Investors need math, not adjectives.

### Example 8: Emotional

**Bad:** "Your dream home awaits!"
**Good:** "The home where your kids will measure their height on the kitchen doorframe."
**Why:** Specific emotional image that resonates with family buyers.

## Headline Testing Framework

When generating multiple headline options, use this framework to evaluate quality:

### The 3-Second Test
Read the headline, look away, and try to recall it 3 seconds later. If you can't remember the gist, it's not memorable enough.

### The "So What?" Test
After reading the headline, ask "so what?" If the answer is "nothing — this could be about any home," revise.

### The Specificity Score
Count the specific details in the headline. Address, price, neighborhood, bed count, a unique feature — each one scores a point. Headlines with 0 specifics almost always underperform.

| Score | Assessment | Example |
|-------|------------|---------|
| 0 | Fails | "Beautiful Home for Sale" |
| 1 | Weak | "Beautiful Home in Bozeman" |
| 2 | Acceptable | "3 Bed Home in Bozeman" |
| 3 | Strong | "3 Bed in Meadowlark — $485K" |
| 4 | Excellent | "742 Birch St | 3 Bed | Meadowlark | $485K" |

### The Differentiation Test
Could a competitor use this exact headline for their listing? If yes, it's not differentiated enough. The best headlines can only belong to one property.
