# Tone Definitions Guide

## Overview

Tone is the personality of your copy. It's not what you say — it's how you say it. The same property described in three different tones will attract three different audiences, create three different impressions, and prompt three different actions.

Real estate ad copy uses three primary tones: **Professional**, **Casual**, and **Luxury**. Each has distinct vocabulary, sentence structure, punctuation patterns, and emotional registers. Mixing tones within a single ad creates dissonance and undermines credibility. Choosing the wrong tone for the audience wastes the ad's potential.

This guide defines each tone precisely, provides markers to identify them, lists what breaks each tone, and includes side-by-side comparisons of the same property across all three.

---

## Professional Tone

### Definition
Authoritative, informative, trustworthy. The professional tone communicates competence and reliability. It positions the agent as a knowledgeable advisor and the property as a sound decision. This is the default tone for most real estate communications.

### Markers

**Vocabulary:**
- Precise, specific language
- Industry terms used correctly but not excessively
- Data-supported claims: "12% appreciation over 18 months" not "amazing growth"
- Qualifiers when appropriate: "well-maintained," "recently updated," "strategically located"
- Neutral descriptors: "spacious," "efficient," "functional," "versatile"

**Sentence Structure:**
- Complete sentences, moderate length (12-20 words average)
- Subject-verb-object clarity
- Active voice preferred: "The kitchen features..." not "There is a kitchen that has..."
- Occasional compound sentences for flow
- Bulleted lists for feature sets

**Punctuation:**
- Standard punctuation throughout
- One exclamation mark per ad maximum — ideally zero
- Em dashes for emphasis or asides
- Semicolons acceptable for connecting related ideas
- No emoji

**What to Avoid:**
- Slang or colloquialisms: "this place is a steal"
- Excessive enthusiasm: "AMAZING!!!"
- First-person editorializing: "I love this kitchen!"
- Casual contractions in headlines: "it's" works in body copy, but "It Is" is stronger in headlines
- Hedging language: "sort of," "pretty nice," "kind of"

### Professional Tone Vocabulary Bank

**Positive descriptors:** well-appointed, meticulously maintained, thoughtfully designed, strategically located, recently renovated, highly sought-after, move-in ready, energy-efficient, generously proportioned, private, sun-filled, updated, functional, versatile

**Action words:** schedule, inquire, explore, discover, contact, review, consider, invest, secure, tour

**Transition phrases:** additionally, the property also offers, beyond the main level, complementing the interior, located within walking distance, recent improvements include

### Example

```
Just Listed | 742 Birch Street, Bozeman | $485,000

This meticulously maintained 3-bedroom, 2-bathroom ranch
in Bozeman's Meadowlark neighborhood offers 1,680 square
feet of single-level living in one of the city's most
walkable areas.

The kitchen was fully renovated in 2024 with quartzite
countertops, custom maple cabinetry, and stainless steel
appliances. Hardwood floors run throughout the main living
areas, and the open floor plan creates a natural flow
between the kitchen, dining, and living spaces.

The primary bedroom includes a walk-in closet and en-suite
bathroom. Two additional bedrooms share an updated hall
bathroom with a double vanity.

Outside, the fully fenced backyard features mature
landscaping, an automated irrigation system, and a
flagstone patio with mountain views. The attached two-car
garage includes built-in storage and an EV charging outlet.

Recent updates include a new HVAC system (2024), exterior
paint (2023), and a 30-year architectural shingle roof
(2021).

Meadowlark is a quiet, established neighborhood with
sidewalk connectivity, proximity to Lindley Park (0.3 mi),
and easy access to downtown Bozeman (0.6 mi).

Open house Saturday, March 15, 10 AM - 12 PM.
Private showings available by appointment.

## Casual Tone

### Definition
Warm, conversational, relatable. The casual tone sounds like a friend who happens to know real estate really well. It breaks down barriers between agent and buyer, creates approachability, and makes the property feel accessible. This tone works best on social media, for first-time buyer targeting, and for properties that sell on personality rather than prestige.

### Markers

**Vocabulary:**
- Everyday language, no jargon without explanation
- Contractions: "it's," "you'll," "don't," "won't," "that's"
- Colloquial phrases (measured): "honestly," "seriously," "real talk"
- Enthusiasm through specifics, not superlatives: "this kitchen though" not "amazing stunning kitchen"
- Direct address: "you" appears frequently

**Sentence Structure:**
- Shorter sentences, varied length (5-15 words average)
- Fragments allowed for emphasis: "Walk to everything. Seriously."
- Questions used conversationally: "Know what the best part is?"
- First person occasionally: "I'm hosting an open house Saturday"
- Parenthetical asides: "(they even put in automatic sprinklers)"

**Punctuation:**
- Dashes for conversational asides
- Ellipses sparingly for trailing thoughts...
- One exclamation mark acceptable (not per sentence — per ad)
- Strategic emoji on social platforms (one to three, contextual)
- Period-separated fragments for rhythm: "Walk to Lindley Park. Walk to the co-op. Walk to basically everything."

**What to Avoid:**
- Formality that sounds stiff: "The residence offers" → "This home has"
- Sounding like a press release: "We are proud to present" → "Check this out"
- Overcasual to the point of unprofessional: "yo this crib is sick" is too far
- Excessive slang that alienates older audiences
- Self-deprecation or apologies: "I know this isn't the fanciest but..."
- Forced humor that doesn't land naturally

### Casual Tone Vocabulary Bank

**Positive descriptors:** solid, cozy, clean, bright, spacious, well-loved, move-in ready, tucked away, charming, updated, real (as in "a real backyard"), actual (as in "an actual home office")

**Action words:** check out, come see, grab, swing by, DM me, message, take a look, stop by, hit me up, save this

**Transition phrases:** oh and, plus, the best part, but wait, here's the thing, also worth mentioning, and honestly

### Example

```
Okay but this kitchen though.

742 Birch Street just came on the market and I genuinely
think it's one of the best values in Bozeman right now.
$485K for a fully updated 3-bed ranch in Meadowlark?
With THAT kitchen? Come on.

The owners have babied this house for 20 years and it
shows. New kitchen last year (we're talking quartzite
counters, real wood cabinets, the whole deal), new HVAC,
and a backyard that looks like it belongs in a magazine.

Three bedrooms, two baths, hardwood floors, and the kind
of open layout where you can actually see the living room
from the kitchen (crucial when you have kids, dogs, or
both).

Walk to Lindley Park. Walk to the co-op. Walk to
basically everything.

I'm doing an open house Saturday 10-12 if you want to
see it in person. Or DM me and I'll get you in before
then. Fair warning — I don't think this one sits long.

## Luxury Tone

### Definition
Elevated, sensory, exclusive. The luxury tone doesn't sell a house — it curates an experience. It assumes the reader is discerning, has options, and will choose based on quality, uniqueness, and feeling rather than price per square foot. This tone is reserved for high-end properties, luxury publications, and audiences who value craftsmanship and distinction.

### Markers

**Vocabulary:**
- Sensory language: textures, light, materials, sounds
- Specificity about materials and craftsmanship: "hand-hewn timber" not "wood beams"
- Understated confidence: no superlatives, no exclamation marks
- Exclusivity signals: "private," "curated," "bespoke," "one-of-a-kind"
- Experiential language: "unfolds," "reveals," "retreats," "anchors"
- References to provenance: where materials came from, who designed the space

**Sentence Structure:**
- Varied lengths, including longer flowing sentences
- Intentional rhythm: short sentences for impact, longer ones for description
- Inverted syntax occasionally: "Beyond the terrace, the garden unfolds"
- No bulleted lists — everything in narrative prose
- Sentence fragments for dramatic effect: "Five bedrooms. Twelve acres. One of a kind."

**Punctuation:**
- Em dashes for elegant pauses
- Periods for emphasis through brevity
- No exclamation marks — ever
- No emoji — ever
- Minimal commas in series — use shorter sentences instead of long compound ones

**What to Avoid:**
- Price-per-square-foot language
- "Affordable," "deal," "steal," "bargain," "won't last"
- "Dream home" (too common, not exclusive)
- Casual language: "check it out," "this place is awesome"
- Feature dumps without sensory context
- Comparisons to other properties: luxury stands alone
- Exclamation marks or ALL CAPS under any circumstances
- Overly formal language that becomes pretentious: "One would find the parlour most agreeable"

### Luxury Tone Vocabulary Bank

**Positive descriptors:** refined, distinguished, bespoke, considered, intentional, thoughtful, artisanal, curated, exceptional, rare, storied, singular, timeless, understated, gracious, unhurried

**Materials and craftsmanship:** hand-selected, locally quarried, custom-milled, reclaimed, forged, honed, commissioned, architectural-grade, artisan-crafted

**Experiential words:** unfolds, reveals, anchors, frames, transitions, retreats, commands, embraces, dissolves, suspends

**Spatial language:** volume, proportion, scale, axis, threshold, gallery, corridor

**Transition phrases:** beyond, where, as the day unfolds, at the threshold of, set against, overlooking, upon entering

### Example

```
On the Banks of the Gallatin

Where the river bends and the cottonwoods lean toward
the water, a residence of uncommon restraint occupies
twelve acres of Montana's most coveted landscape.

The architecture is deliberate — hand-hewn timbers
sourced from a single stand of reclaimed Douglas fir,
walls of glass that frame the Gallatin's course, and
stone gathered from the property's own creek bed.
Nothing here is incidental.

The kitchen — designed around a 12-foot walnut island
— opens to a covered terrace where the sound of the
river replaces conversation when conversation needs
replacing. Beyond the great room, a private wing holds
the primary suite: floor-to-ceiling glass, a soaking
tub positioned at the view, and a closet that functions
as a dressing room.

Four additional bedrooms occupy the upper level, each
with its own bathroom, each oriented to a different
aspect of the property — the river, the meadow, the
timber, the mountains.

Below grade: a temperature-controlled wine room, a
screening room with acoustic treatment, and a gym with
direct access to the lap pool.

Outside, the grounds unfold in layers — formal gardens
near the house giving way to native meadow, then timber,
then river. A guest cabin sits at the far boundary,
private enough to feel separate, close enough to remain
connected.

Offered at $3,200,000.
Private viewings by arrangement.

| Casual language | "Check out this sick kitchen" | "The kitchen anchors the main level" |
| Feature dumping | "5 bed, 4 bath, pool, gym, wine cellar" | Describe each space narratively |
| Comparisons | "Better than anything else on the market" | Luxury stands alone. No comparisons. |
| Emoji | Any emoji at all | Remove entirely |
| "Dream home" | "Your dream home awaits" | "A residence of quiet distinction" |

### Casual

```
$485K in Meadowlark and yes, that kitchen is brand new.

3 bed, 2 bath ranch — hardwood floors, open layout, and
a backyard that's private, fenced, and has mountain views
from the patio. Walk to Lindley Park, walk to the co-op,
walk to pretty much everywhere you'd want to go.

New kitchen, new HVAC, newer roof. It's all been done.

### Luxury

```
A residence of considered simplicity in the heart of
Meadowlark.

Behind the ranch facade, an interior reimagined with
intention — hand-selected hardwoods, a kitchen rebuilt
around quartzite and custom maple, and proportions
that favor light and air over ornamentation.

The rear garden, framed by mature trees and anchored
by a flagstone terrace, opens to a view of the Bridgers
that shifts with every hour of the day.

Steps from Lindley Park. A lifetime from ordinary.

### Analysis

| Element | Professional | Casual | Luxury |
|---------|-------------|--------|--------|
| Opening | Address + price + facts | Price + personal reaction | Evocative description |
| Details | Specific, measured | Conversational, selective | Sensory, narrative |
| Features | Listed with data | Commented on with personality | Described experientially |
| CTA | "Open house or by appointment" | "Come through or DM me" | "Private viewings by arrangement" |
| Price presentation | "$485,000" | "$485K" | "$485,000" |
| Personality | Minimal, trustworthy | High, relatable | Curated, elevated |
| Best for | Listing platforms, email | Social media, first-time buyers | Luxury publications, high-end clients |

---

## Choosing the Right Tone

### Decision Matrix

| Factor | Professional | Casual | Luxury |
|--------|-------------|--------|--------|
| Property price | Any | Under $750K typically | $750K+ or unique |
| Target audience | General, agents | First-time buyers, social media users | High-net-worth, second-home buyers |
| Platform | MLS, Realtor.com, email | Instagram, Facebook, Twitter | Magazine, luxury publications |
| Property type | Any | Starter homes, condos, family homes | Estates, waterfront, architectural |
| Market position | Standard | Accessible, approachable | Exclusive, aspirational |
| Agent brand | Established, corporate | Young, personable | Luxury specialist |

### Blending Rules

**Generally avoid blending tones.** Each tone has internal consistency that creates trust. Blending creates tonal whiplash.

**Exception:** Professional with hints of casual works on Facebook. A professional foundation with a few casual touches (a contraction, a conversational aside) can feel both trustworthy and approachable.

**Never blend:** Casual and luxury. The contrast is too stark. A sentence like "This bespoke kitchen is honestly sick" will confuse every reader.
